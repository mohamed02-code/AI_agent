      "The patient was a 32-year-old female, mother of a 13-month-old boy who was directly breastfed since birth with complementary food added at 6 months of age. She had postpartum depression, felt deeply anxious, and insisted on staying with her child. The patient and her son were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. On admission, the patient had nasal congestion, but no rhinorrhea, cough, sputum, fever, or fatigue. The physical examination revealed a body temperature of 36.4 °C, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, a pulse of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 102/74 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% while breathing ambient air. Lung auscultation indicated no abnormalities. The results of a routine blood tests (complete blood count, liver and renal function), C-reactive protein, and chest Xray were normal. Respiratory virus antigen quadruplet test (Influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus) and the nucleic acid test for Influenza A and B virus were negative. The patient received atomized inhalation of recombinant human interferon α-2b 5 million International Unit (IU) in 2 mL sterilized water twice a day as the antiviral treatment from hospital day one to day 28 and traditional Chinese medicine as a supplemental therapy from hospital day four to day 28. She continued directly breastfeeding four to five times every day. The symptom of nasal congestion improved on hospital day 2, and white blood cell count declined to 2.7 × 109/L, while the lymphocyte count was 0.9 × 109/L. The nasopharyngeal swab specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but the serum was negative. On hospital day 3, the symptoms of nasal congestion disappeared, not to return. The mother’s body temperature and oxygen saturation without oxygen inhalation were monitored and remained within the normal range, and the patient was in stable condition. On hospital day 4, the plain chest CT scan indicated the presence of density-increased patchy consolidation and ground-glass shadow in the lower lobe of the right lung, and viral pneumonia was the likely diagnosis. Subsequently, on hospital day 10, white blood cell and lymphocyte counts returned to a normal level, and liver and renal function and myocardial enzyme tests continued to be normal. During the period of hospitalization, the mother’s serum, milk, and feces specimens tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but the nasopharyngeal swabs were repeatedly positive. Chest CT scans on hospital days 10 and 23 showed the gradual clearing of the lungs. On hospital days 9 and 25 after admission, the breastmilk tests yielded a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and negative for IgM. Similarly, the maternal serum was positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and negative for IgM on hospital days 16 and 20. On hospital day 28, the patient was discharged as three consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid.\n",
      "The patient’s 13-month-old son had a fever, occasional dry cough, and nasal congestion at admission to the hospital. The physical examination revealed a body temperature of 37.6 °C, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, a pulse of 105 beats per minute, blood pressure of 95/56 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 99% while breathing ambient air, and bodyweight of 10 kg. There was no abnormality in lung auscultation. During the hospitalization, antiviral treatment with atomized inhalation of recombinant human interferon α-2b 1.5 million International Unit (IU) in 2 mL sterilized water was performed twice a day for 8 days, from day 1 to day 8 of hospitalization. On the day of admission, the white blood cell count was low at 3.7 × 109/L, and lymphocyte count was 2 × 109/L. The infant’s serum tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. On hospital day 2, the temperature returned to the normal value, and remained normal thereafter, but occasional dry cough and runny nose continued. On hospital day 4, feces and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, and plain chest CT scan revealed ground-glass shadows in the lower lobe of the right lung. On hospital day 6, the child’s cough was essentially resolved, while occasional rhinorrhea persisted. At that time, the counts of white blood cells and lymphocytes were 6.9 × 109/L and 5.1 × 109/L, respectively. The child became free of symptoms on hospital day 7. On hospital day 14, the serum was negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid,\n",

The relevant entities list it as false, and the procedure was an epidural injection, which isn't classified as recent surgery or trauma for PERC. Immobilization? She had mobility issues, but no mention of prolonged immobility leading to DVT risk. Pregnancy? Not applicable. Hemoptysis? Also false. Unilateral leg swelling? No. DVT history? Also false.

      "However, note that the PERC criteria are designed to rule out PE. A score of 0 is used to rule out PE. A score of 1 or more does not rule out PE.\n",

      "But the question is: calculate the PERC score. So we are just counting the number of criteria that are met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the score is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's double-check the criteria. The standard PERC criteria (as per the original 1997 study and subsequent updates) include:\n",
      "- Age ≥ 50 years\n",
      "- Oxygen saturation ≤ 94%\n",
      "- Heart rate ≥ 100 bpm\n",

      "\n",
      "Therefore, the PERC score is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But note: the patient has a history of palpitations and near syncope, and the ECG showed WPW syndrome. However, the PERC score is specifically for ruling out PE, and the patient's presentation is more consistent with an arrhythmia (WPW) than PE. But the PERC score is still calculated based on the criteria regardless of the clinical suspicion.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer should be 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, we must also note that the patient has a very high heart rate (210-230 bpm) and was treated with cardioversion. This is not typical for PE. But the PERC score is about risk factors for PE.\n",

      "Therefore, we calculate the PERC score as follows:\n",

      "We are calculating the PERC score for a patient with possible postoperative pulmonary embolism (PE). The PERC (Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria) score is used to rule out PE in low-risk patients. The criteria are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Age <50 years\n",
      "- Heart rate ≤100/min\n",
      "- Oxygen saturation ≥95% on room air\n",
      "- No unilateral leg swelling\n",
      "- No previous documented DVT\n",

      "\n",
      "Let's go through each criterion for the given patient:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Age**: The patient is 65 years old. The PERC criteria require age <50 years to score 0. Since 65 > 50, this patient does not meet the age criterion for scoring 0. However, note that the PERC score is calculated by assigning points (or not) for each criterion. The PERC score is the number of criteria that are not met (i.e., the patient does not meet the condition). Each criterion that is not met (i.e., the patient does not have that condition) contributes 1 point to the score.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Heart rate**: The patient's pulse is 110/min. The PERC criterion is heart rate ≤100/min. Since 110 > 100, the patient does not meet this criterion. Therefore, we assign 1 point.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **O₂ saturation percentage**: The patient's oxygen saturation is 85%. The PERC criterion is ≥95%. Since 85% < 95%, the patient does not meet this criterion. Therefore, we assign 1 point.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Unilateral Leg Swelling**: The relevant entities state \"Unilateral Leg Swelling\": False. So the patient does not have unilateral leg swelling. This criterion is not met (i.e., no unilateral leg swelling) so we assign 1 point.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Previously documented Deep Vein Thrombosis**: The relevant entities state \"Previously Documented Deep Vein Thrombosis\": False. So the patient does not have a history of DVT. This criterion is not met (i.e., no previous DVT) so we assign 1 point.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism**: The relevant entities state \"Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism\": False. So the patient does not have a history of PE. This criterion is not met (i.e., no previous PE) so we assign 1 point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's list the criteria that are not met (i.e., the patient does not have the condition) and count them:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Heart rate >100: 1 point\n",
      "- Oxygen saturation <95%: 1 point\n",
      "- No unilateral leg swelling: 1 point\n",
      "- No previous DVT: 1 point\n",
      "- No previous PE: 1 point\n",

      "- Heart rate ≤100/min\n",
      "- Oxygen saturation ≥95% on room air\n",

The PERC score is calculated only if the patient meets the baseline criteria. If the patient does not meet the baseline criteria, then the PERC rule-out is not applicable and we must do other tests.\n",

      "5. No previous documented DVT\n",
      "6. No previous documented PE\n",

      "- Previous PE: (if present, score +=1)\n",

      "\n",
      "But note: the question says \"Calculate PERC score for this patient.\" and the relevant entities include age, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and the history of DVT and PE. However, the PERC rule-out is only valid if the patient meets the baseline criteria (age ≥50, heart rate ≤100, O2 sat ≥95%, no unilateral leg swelling, no previous DVT, no previous PE).\n",

      "- Previous PE: false -> so the criterion (no previous PE) is met.\n",
      "\n",
      "But because the patient does not meet the baseline criteria (heart rate and oxygen saturation), the PERC rule-out is not applicable.

      "11. **Other acute illness**: He had pneumonia later, but at the time of PERC calculation (when he presented with symptoms), he had a cough and hemoptysis. However, PERC is typically applied when the patient presents with symptoms like these. The pneumonia occurred at follow-up. Since the initial symptoms included hemoptysis and productive cough, and no other acute illness is mentioned at that time, it might not count. But typically, if the patient is presenting with acute respiratory symptoms, it could be considered. However, the PERC criteria are for patients without suspected PE who present with certain symptoms. Given that the patient had a recent lung biopsy showing SCLC, and the PERC is being calculated for the initial presentation, we should stick to the initial symptoms. The pneumonia developed later, so it's not part of the initial assessment. Therefore, no point for other acute illness at this time.\n",

Therefore, it is considered hormone use. But note: the PERC criteria do not specify the type of hormonal therapy, and since it is a hormonal agent, it would count as hormone use. However, let's check the data: the patient has been on these for a while (since discharge after surgery). The criteria state \"no hormone use\", meaning no recent use. We must determine if the current use (which is ongoing) would count. Since the patient is on these medications and they are hormonal, we must consider this as hormone use. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait: the PERC criteria are for patients who have been on hormone therapy for less than 6 months? Actually, the criteria say \"no use of oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, or progestin-only therapy within the last 6 months\". The patient is currently using these, so it is within the last 6 months? We don't have the exact duration of use, but the patient has been on these since discharge. The discharge was after the surgery. The surgery was 8 days after the thoracocentesis and then the VATS. The patient was discharged 8 days after the VATS? The note says: \"Because the patient’s condition was not significantly improving, a right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)... was performed, which revealed ... No malignancy was reported in the histopathologic examination.\" Then: \"Ultrasonography ... and MRI ... were done; these investigations showed ... the latter finding ... similar to a prior finding ... three years ago.\" Then: \"Because these fluids did not cause any symptoms to the patient, the obstetrics/gynecology team’s decision was not to drain, believing that the endometriosis treatment itself should improve this condition.\" Then: \"Transvaginal ultrasonography and complete pelvic duplex ... showed ... The patient was discharged on Leuprolide Depot 11.25 mg injections every three months and norethindrone hormonal therapy ... with a close outpatient follow-up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the patient started these medications after the VATS (and hence after the surgery and the hospitalization). Since the surgery and hospitalization ended, and she was discharged, we can assume that the hormone use started at that time. Therefore, within the last 6 months (if we consider the current time as the time of the chest tube insertion and surgery, which was 8 days prior to discharge, then discharge was about 8 days after surgery). But the time of the discharge is when the hormone use started. We are not given the exact discharge date relative to the current date. However, the question is about the patient's condition at the time of the evaluation for PERC. The patient is being evaluated in the emergency department for the right pleural effusion and atelectasis. The PERC criteria are applied to the patient at that time. The patient is on hormone therapy at that time (since she was just discharged). Therefore, she is currently using hormone therapy and it has been for a few days (if we assume discharge was the start). But the criteria require that there has been no use within the last 6 months. Since the use started within the last 6 months (if we assume the discharge was within 6 months of the current evaluation), then she meets the criterion? Or does she?\n",

      "The PERC criteria require that there has been no use of such hormones within the last 6 months. If the patient started the hormones within the last 6 months, then she has been using them within the last 6 months. Therefore, she does not meet the criterion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But note: the patient may have started the hormones more than 6 months ago? The note does not specify when she started. We have to rely on the information given. The patient was discharged on these medications. The surgery and hospitalization ended at discharge. The time of discharge is not given relative to the current evaluation. However, the question is about the patient's condition at the time of the evaluation. We must use the information provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the patient's history: she has a history of endometriosis and had a cyst removal 5 years ago and a paracentesis 3 years ago. The last follow-up with OB/GYN was 13 months ago. Now, she is being discharged and started on Leuprolide and norethindrone. We don't have the exact time of discharge relative to the current date. But the current evaluation is for the pleural effusion and atelectasis. The PERC criteria are applied at the time of the emergency visit. The patient is currently on hormone therapy and has been for a short time (if we assume discharge was recently). Therefore, we must consider that the hormone use started within the last 6 months. Thus, she does not meet the criterion.\n",

      "Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has provided a detailed medical case and wants me to calculate the PERC score for this 17-year-old female patient. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to recall that PERC is a clinical decision tool used to rule out pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with acute chest pain or dyspnea. The relevant entities in this case include vital signs, physical exam findings, and lab results, but I must focus only on the specific PERC criteria listed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the patient's presentation: she has severe anemia (Hb 7.3 g/dL), low BMI (20.1 kg/m²), elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 65.4 mg/L, ESR 132 mm/h), and no fever (temp 101.6°F is actually elevated but not the cause). Her symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and orthostatic tremors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now checking PERC criteria one by one:\n",
      "- Heart rate ≥100 bpm? No, it's 125 (yes, meets criterion)\n",
      "- Oxygen saturation <90%? No, it's 97% (doesn't meet)\n",
      "- Chest pain? Not mentioned in history\n",
      "- Hemoptysis? Physical exam shows no blood in sputum\n",
      "- Leg swelling? Unilateral? No\n",
      "- History of DVT/PE? No\n",
      "- Hormone use? Yes (oral contraceptives)\n",
      "- Surgery/trauma? No\n",
      "\n",
      "The key points are: elevated heart rate (125), elevated inflammatory markers, no contraindications like hemoptysis or leg swelling. But since she has anemia and dyspnea, PERC might not be fully applicable. The PERC score is calculated by counting positive criteria - here we have 3 positive items (HR>100, elevated CRP, elevated ESR).\n",
      "\n",
      "I recall that for anemia patients, PERC should be applied cautiously. The guidelines suggest checking for risk factors like recent surgery or malignancy, but here the labs show no active infection or malignancy. The elevated inflammatory markers likely point to an underlying inflammatory condition rather than PE.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final score calculation: 3 positive items (HR>100, CRP>5mg/dL, ESR>20mm/h) equals a PERC score of 3. This indicates a positive result for PE risk, though clinical judgment should consider her anemia and other symptoms.\n",

      "3. **Chest pain**  \n",

      "5. **Unilateral leg swelling**  \n",
      "   - **Scored 0**  \n",
      "   - *Reason:* No unilateral leg swelling was observed (edema was nonpitting and bilateral).  \n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Previously documented PE or DVT**  \n",
      "   - **Scored 0**  \n",

      "\n",
      "7. **Recent surgery or trauma**  \n",

      "\n",
      "8. **Hormone use**  \n",

      "   - *Reason:* She had **oral contraceptive use** (historically, though discontinued 6 months ago).  \n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Elevated inflammatory markers (CRP/ESR)**  \n",
      "   - **Scored +1**  \n",

      "- **Anemia (Hb 7.3 g/dL)**: While severe anemia is a concern, PERC does not exclude it. However, anemia may reduce sensitivity for PE risk assessment, and further evaluation for alternative diagnoses (e.g., inflammatory conditions) is warranted.  \n",
      "- **Elevated inflammatory markers**: Point to possible underlying infection, autoimmune disorder, or malignancy (e.g., thalassemia trait in her Burmese heritage), which may contribute to anemia and symptoms.  \n",
      "- **Low BMI (20.1 kg/m²)**: Not a PERC criterion, but may support risk for PE.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### PERC Score Summary:\n",
      "- **Positive Criteria**: Heart rate >100 bpm, hormone use, elevated CRP/ESR.  \n",
      "- **Total PERC Score**: **3** (indicating a **positive result**; pulmonary embolism should be considered).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Implication:\n",
      "Given the elevated inflammatory markers, anemia, and tachycardia, **further workup for PE is indicated despite the PERC score.** Additional tests (e.g., D-dimer, CT pulmonary angiography) may be needed. Also evaluate for underlying causes of anemia (e.g., inflammatory anemia, nutritional deficiencies) and her family history (e.g., thalassemia).\n",

      " However, note that the PERC score is calculated by counting the number of risk factors present from the list. The criteria are:\n",

      "Alright, let's tackle this PERC score calculation for the patient. First, I need to recall what the PERC criteria are. PERC stands for Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria, and it's used to quickly assess if a patient can be safely excluded from having a pulmonary embolism (PE) without further testing. The criteria are specific, so I'll go through each one step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient is a 9-year-old boy with symptoms including pallor, lethargy, shortness of breath, headache, yellowish sclera, and a history of upper respiratory infection followed by diarrhea. His vital signs show a heart rate of 118 bpm, which is tachycardic. His oxygen saturation is 100%, which is normal. The relevant entities provided don't mention unilateral leg swelling, recent surgery, or any history of DVT or PE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, checking each PERC criterion:\n",
      "1. **Tachypnea**: Respiratory rate is 20/min. Since the patient is a child, I need to consider the normal range. For children aged 5-12, normal respiratory rate is typically 20-30 breaths per minute. A rate of 20 is at the upper limit but might not be considered tachypneic. However, in PERC guidelines, a respiratory rate ≥25 is used for adults. Since this patient is a child, I should look at pediatric norms. The PERC criteria use age-specific values. For children, tachypnea is often defined as a respiratory rate ≥20 for ages 5-12. But the PERC criteria themselves don't specify pediatric adjustments, so I'll stick to the standard adult thresholds unless noted otherwise. Given that, 20/min might not meet the tachypnea criterion for PERC, which typically requires ≥25 bpm for adults. However, since the patient is a child, I should check if the PERC includes pediatric adjustments. Upon second thought, the PERC criteria are primarily for adults, but they can be adapted for children by using the pediatric respiratory rate threshold. For children aged 5-12, tachypnea is often ≥20-22 breaths per minute. But PERC specifically states ≥25 for adults. Since the patient is 9 years old, which falls in the 5-12 age group, the respiratory rate of 20 might be borderline. However, in the absence of specific pediatric PERC guidelines, I'll use the standard adult cutoff. Therefore, 20/min is below 25, so tachypnea is not met.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Heart rate**: The heart rate is 118 bpm. For adults, tachycardia is defined as ≥100 bpm. Since 118 is above 100, this would be a positive criterion for tachycardia.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Hypotension**: Blood pressure is 119/61 mmHg. For adults, hypotension is defined as systolic BP <90 mmHg or diastolic BP <60 mmHg. Here, systolic is 119 (above 90) and diastolic is 61 (above 60), so no hypotension.\n",

      "4. **Oxygen saturation**: 100% is normal, so no hypoxia.\n",

      "7. **Unilateral leg swelling**: The relevant entities indicate no unilateral leg swelling.\n",

      "8. **Signs of PE**: The patient has no signs like chest pain, hemoptysis, or syncope mentioned. Also, no unilateral leg swelling or other signs.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Age**: The patient is 9 years old, which is below 40, so age is not a factor for exclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, applying the criteria:\n",
      "- Tachypnea: Respiratory rate 20/min. For adults, this is not tachypneic (≥25). Since the patient is a child, I need to consider pediatric norms. However, PERC criteria don't specify pediatric adjustments. Using standard adult thresholds, 20 is not ≥25, so not met.\n",
      "- Tachycardia: Heart rate 118 bpm >100 → met.\n",
      "- No hypotension.\n",
      "- Oxygen saturation normal.\n",
      "- No recent surgery or trauma.\n",
      "- No prior DVT or PE.\n",
      "- No unilateral leg swelling.\n",
      "- No signs of PE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, only one criterion (tachycardia) is met. According to PERC, if any of the criteria are met, the patient should be evaluated for PE, and PERC cannot be used to rule out PE. Since tachycardia is present, the PERC score is not applicable for exclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the PERC score itself is calculated by counting the number of criteria met. Here, only one criterion is met (tachycardia). However, because the patient has a heart rate of 118 bpm, which is tachycardia, the PERC criteria indicate that PE should not be ruled out based on PERC alone. The PERC score would be 1, but it's not zero, meaning exclusion is not possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the PERC score is the number of criteria met. So in this case, it's 1. But since one criterion is met, the patient cannot be excluded from PE. So the PERC score is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me double-check the respiratory rate. The patient is 9 years old. For children, tachypnea is often defined as ≥20-22 breaths per minute for ages 5-12. However, the PERC criteria are standardized for adults and use ≥25. Since the guidelines don't specify pediatric adjustments, I'll go with the adult threshold. So 20/min is not tachypneic.\n",

      "But let me double-check the PERC criteria: the original PERC criteria (for snakebite envenomation) include:\n",

      "So we have two positive criteria. Therefore, the PERC score is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, note that the patient was already in the hospital and had been envenomated. The PERC score is typically used in the field. But the question asks for the PERC score for this patient. We must calculate it based on the given criteria.\n",

      "But wait, the patient was intubated because of impending airway obstruction. The respiratory rate is not given. We must stick to the provided entities. Since respiratory rate is not in the entities, we cannot include it. Therefore, we only have two positive criteria.\n",

      "Thus, the PERC score is 1.\n",

      "But note: the PERC score is 1 if any of the criteria are met. So regardless of how many are met, the score is 1? Actually, the PERC score is defined as 1 if any one of the criteria is met. So two positive criteria still give a score of 1.\n",

The clinical presentation and laboratory tests led to a diagnosis of TPP (Thiamine deficiency) which caused hyperkalemia? Or perhaps it was a different cause? The case does not specify the exact cause of hyperkalemia. But note that the patient had low potassium initially (2.3 mEq/L) and then it increased to 10.1 mEq/L. The initial hyperkalemia was not due to renal failure? The creatinine was normal. The urinary toxicology was negative. The cause of hyperkalemia is not clear from the given data. However, the patient was treated with potassium and then potassium levels increased. The patient was diagnosed with TPP? The case says: \"A diagnosis of TPP was made based on clinical presentation and laboratory results.\" TPP is Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Thiamine deficiency can cause hyperkalemia? Actually, thiamine deficiency is more associated with beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and it can cause hyperkalemia? Not typically.

      "- Vital signs after extubation (3 days post-transplant, in upright position):\n",
      "  - Heart rate: 120 beats per minute (which is elevated, but note that the PERC criteria do not include heart rate; we have a separate criterion for respiratory rate which is 24 breaths/min in the upright position. However, the heart rate of 120 is not a criterion in the PERC score. The PERC score does not include heart rate as a criterion.)\n",

The surgery was 3 days ago, which is within the 2-week window. However, note that the criteria also specify that the surgery must be recent and within the past 2 weeks. So, this meets criterion 7.\n",

However, the PERC criterion is for oxygen saturation on room air. The case does not report oxygen saturation on room air, but we have saturation on 100% oxygen. The criterion is for room air. We must note that the patient was in an upright position and had desaturation to 80% on 100% oxygen. However, the PERC criterion 4 is for oxygen saturation ≤90% on room air. The case does not provide the room air saturation. But note that the patient was extubated and then developed hypoxia in the upright position. The oxygen saturation at room air is not provided. We cannot assume. Therefore, we might not have data for this criterion? But wait, the vital signs in the recumbent position show oxygen saturation of 94% (normal). Then, in the upright position, they are on 100% oxygen and saturate to 80%. However, the PERC criterion 4 is for oxygen saturation on room air. Since we don't have the room air saturation, we cannot score this as met? Or should we consider that the patient was hypoxic in the upright position on 100% oxygen? The PERC criterion is specifically for room air. Without the room air saturation, we cannot apply this criterion. But note: the patient was extubated and then developed hypoxia in the upright position. The oxygen saturation on room air is not given. Therefore, we cannot assume that the room air saturation was low. Thus, we might not have enough information to score this criterion? However, the case does mention that in the upright position with 100% oxygen, the oxygen saturation was 80%. But the PERC criterion is for room air. We have to rely on what is provided. Since the room air saturation is not provided, we cannot score criterion 4? Alternatively, the case does not report any room air saturation? The only oxygen saturation reported is 94% in recumbency and 80% in upright on 100% oxygen. Therefore, we cannot score criterion 4 because we don't have the room air saturation.\n",

      "But wait: the patient was extubated and then in the recumbent position, the oxygen saturation was 94%. Then, in the upright position, they started supplemental oxygen and became hypoxic.

      "Alternatively, note that the patient was extubated and then developed hypoxia in the upright position. The oxygen saturation in the upright position was 80% on 100% oxygen. But the criterion is for room air. Without the room air saturation, we cannot apply this criterion. Therefore, we will not score this.\n",

      "However, let's reexamine the case: \"In an upright position, however, he became ... and hypoxic with desaturations to 80% while receiving 100% supplemental oxygen\". This implies that without oxygen, the saturation would have been worse. But we don't have the number. So, we cannot score criterion 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "But note: the case also says \"in recumbency, oxygen saturation of 94%\". So, in the recumbent position, the oxygen saturation is 94% (room air). Then, in the upright position, they are on 100% oxygen and saturation is 80%. This suggests that the room air saturation in the upright position might have been lower, but we don't have it. Therefore, we cannot score criterion 4.\n",

      "Criterion 3: respiratory rate ≥24 breaths per minute? The case says in the upright position, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute (which is equal to 24, so it is ≥24). But note: the PERC criteria are for the patient at the time of extubation. The patient was extubated and then developed hypoxia in the upright position. The respiratory rate at the time of extubation (recumbent) was 60? Actually, the case says: \"vital signs remained normal with recumbency with a heart rate of 60 beats/min\". It does not specify the respiratory rate in the recumbent position. Then, in the upright position, it became tachypneic with respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min.

      "2.  **Opportunistic Infection:** Despite negative initial cultures and antigen tests, it's possible the infection was atypical, slow-growing, or occurred later. Continued immunosuppression (prednisone, mycophenolate, dapsone) increases risk. Repeated BAL might be needed.\n",
      "3.  **Drug-Induced Pneumonitis:** Dapsone (a sulfone) can cause pneumonitis, presenting with cough and dyspnea. The recent initiation of dapsone (or lack of adequate taper) could be a factor.\n",

      "*   The O2 sat of 93% is slightly low, supporting inflammation or infection rather than pure PE.\n",

The PERC score is a clinical prediction rule that has a high negative predictive value (over 95%) for DVT in the absence of risk factors.\n",

      "The PERC criteria are:\n",
      "1. Age <40 years\n",
      "2. No recent surgery or trauma (within 4 weeks)\n",
      "3. No hormone use (within 14 days)\n",

      "If none of the above 7 items are present, then the patient is considered to have a very low risk of DVT and does not need any further testing.\n",

      "Now, let's extract the relevant information from the patient note:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Age**: The patient is 35 years old. So, age <40 years: **Yes**.\n",
      "- **Recent surgery or trauma**: The patient had a cesarean section, which is a major surgery. The cesarean section was performed at 37 weeks GA. However, the PERC criteria specify \"within 4 weeks\". We need to know when the surgery was? The note says \"elective cesarean section\" and the surgery occurred at admission (which is at 37 weeks). Since the patient is now in the postpartum period (after delivery), we can assume the surgery was recent. However, the note does not specify the exact date of surgery relative to the current admission. But note: the patient was admitted at 37 weeks and the surgery was performed at that time (as an elective cesarean). Since the surgery was the reason for admission, it is recent. Therefore, recent surgery: **Yes**. So this would be a positive factor for PERC (meaning the patient should not be given a PERC score because of this risk factor).\n",
      "- **Hormone use**: The patient was on verapamil, atenolol, and warfarin pre-pregnancy. During pregnancy, she was switched to labetalol and enoxaparin. Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), which is an anticoagulant. The note says that enoxaparin was discontinued one day before the cesarean section and unfractionated heparin was started until 6 hours before the operation. After the surgery, heparin was re-infused 6 hours after the cesarean section. Therefore, during the postpartum period, she was on heparin. Heparin is an anticoagulant, so hormone use (in the sense of medications that increase DVT risk) is present. The PERC criteria include \"no hormone use\" meaning no use of oral contraceptives or estrogen-containing medications. However, note that the term \"hormone use\" in the PERC criteria typically refers to the use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. But in this case, the patient was on enoxaparin and then unfractionated heparin, which are anticoagulants, not hormones. Therefore, the use of these anticoagulants does not fall under the PERC \"hormone use\" criterion. However, the PERC criteria do not list anticoagulant use as a risk factor. But note: the patient was on anticoagulants (warfarin and then heparins) during pregnancy and postpartum. This is a risk factor for bleeding but not for DVT. The PERC criteria do not include anticoagulant use as a risk factor for DVT. Therefore, we should consider if the patient was on any hormone (as in estrogen) during the 14 days prior. The note does not mention any hormone use (like estrogen) in the last 14 days. She was on anticoagulants, which are not hormones. So, we can assume that the patient did not use any hormone (estrogen) in the last 14 days. Therefore, \"no hormone use\": **Yes**.\n",
      "- **Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism**: The note does not mention any history of PE. So, **No**.\n",
      "- **Previously documented Deep Vein Thrombosis**: The note does not mention any history of DVT. So, **No**.\n",
      "- **Leg pain, swelling, or redness**: The note does not mention any symptoms in the legs. So, **No**.\n",
      "- **Calf tenderness**: The note does not mention any calf tenderness. So, **No**.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, we have a critical point: the patient had a recent major surgery (cesarean section). The PERC criteria require that there be no recent surgery or trauma within 4 weeks. The cesarean section was performed at the time of admission (at 37 weeks). Since the patient is postpartum (and the surgery was the reason for admission), we can assume the surgery was within the past 4 weeks. Therefore, the patient has a recent surgery and thus does not meet the PERC criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the PERC score should be interpreted as: because of the recent surgery, the patient is at high risk for DVT and should not be tested with the PERC rule. The PERC rule is only applied when there are no recent surgeries or trauma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that the patient has a recent surgery (cesarean section), we cannot apply the PERC rule. Hence, the PERC score would be considered as not applicable (N/A) or we would not use the rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "But note: the question asks to calculate the PERC score. However, if any of the 7 criteria are positive (meaning the patient does not meet the criteria to be free of risk factors), then the PERC score is not calculated. Instead, we must perform other tests (like ultrasound) to rule out DVT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer is that the PERC score is not applicable because the patient has a recent surgery (cesarean section) within 4 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, let's reexamine the note: the patient had a cesarean section and the surgery was performed at the time of admission. We must know how long ago the surgery was? The note does not specify the exact time from surgery to admission. But the patient was admitted at 37 weeks and the cesarean section was performed then. So, the surgery was recent (within the last 4 weeks). Therefore, the patient does not meet the PERC criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, we cannot assign a PERC score. But if we were to force the calculation, we would note that the 7 criteria are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Age <40: Yes (35)\n",
      "2. No recent surgery or trauma: No (she had a cesarean section)\n",
      "3. No hormone use: Yes (as per above reasoning)\n",
      "4. No PE within 4 weeks: Yes (no history)\n",
      "5. No previous DVT: Yes\n",
      "6. No leg pain, swelling, or redness: Yes\n",
      "7. No calf tenderness: Yes\n",
      "\n",
      "But because of the surgery, the patient does not meet the criteria. Therefore, the PERC score is not applicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the PERC rule is only used when the 7 criteria are all absent. Since one of them (recent surgery) is present, the patient is at risk and should be tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, we cannot calculate a PERC score because the patient does not meet the criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "But note: the question says \"Calculate PERC score\". So, we must follow the standard approach. The PERC score is 0 only if all 7 criteria are met. If any criterion is not met (i.e., the patient has a risk factor), then the score is not 0. However, the PERC rule is designed to be a negative rule. If the 7 criteria are all met, then the score is 0 and DVT is ruled out. Otherwise, we do not use the rule and test the patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, we can say that the patient does not have a 0 PERC score because one of the criteria (recent surgery) is not met. But the PERC score is not 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the PERC score is typically calculated as 0 when all criteria are present. If any criterion is absent, then the score is not 0. But the question asks for the score.

Actually, the patient has right leg numbness and decreased sensation, which may be due to vascular involvement (like in the tibial artery occlusion). However, the PERC criteria specifically require \"unilateral leg swelling\", which is not mentioned. So we can consider this as not meeting (unless the numbness and coolness are part of the same finding as swelling? But note the criteria: unilateral leg swelling). The patient's leg exam is described as having decreased sensation and coolness in the right lower extremity, but no mention of swelling. Therefore, we do not have unilateral leg swelling.

The EKG showed complete heart block and ST changes, and the CTA showed a small defect in the aorta with possible vegetation. The catheterization showed a coronary thrombus. The leg symptoms were due to tibial artery occlusion. So the chest pain was not due to PE? Actually, the chest pain was radiating and associated with diaphoresis and dyspnea, but the EKG and catheterization showed coronary thrombosis. The leg symptoms were due to arterial occlusion.

      " - Heart rate: 114 beats per minute (on admission) -> 114 > 100, so does not meet criterion 3.\n",
      " - Unilateral leg swelling: True (right ankle had purplish discoloration without heat or tenderness, and later duplex sonography showed DVT in the left popliteal, soleal, and peroneal veins). So, we have unilateral leg swelling? The note says \"Unilateral Leg Swelling\": True. This is a criterion for PERC (absence of unilateral leg swelling).

      " - Hemoptysis: Not mentioned. We assume absence (False). So, it meets criterion 5.\n",
      " - History of deep vein thrombosis: The note says \"Previously documented Deep Vein Thrombosis\": True. This is a criterion for PERC (absence of history of DVT). So, we do not meet criterion 6 (which requires no history of DVT).\n",

      "The PERC criteria include the following:\n",
      "- Age ≥50 years\n",
      "- Heart rate >100 bpm\n",

      "- Heart Rate or Pulse: 119.0 bpm (on initial presentation; note that the patient had a history of tachycardia and later episodes up to 140 bpm, but the PERC is typically based on the initial presentation for rule-out)\n",
      "- O₂ saturation percentage: 93.0% (on initial presentation)\n",
      "- Hemoptysis: False (no history of hemoptysis)\n",
      "- Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism: True (the patient had a syncopal episode and the initial clinical suspicion was high, but the CT showed bilateral submassive pulmonary emboli, so we consider this as previously documented PE? However, note that the patient presented with acute symptoms and the emboli were found on CT, so it is a new event? But the PERC criteria are for ruling out PE in a patient who presents with symptoms. The patient does not have a history of prior PE? Let me check the note: the patient is a 55-year-old with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, OSA, and depression. The symptoms (pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope) are acute. The CT showed bilateral submassive PE, so the patient is having a new PE. The PERC criteria do not require prior PE for the rule-out, but if the patient has a prior PE, that might change the risk? Actually, the PERC criteria are for patients with acute symptoms and without prior PE? Let me clarify: the PERC criteria are intended for patients with acute symptoms and without a history of PE or DVT. However, the presence of a prior PE or DVT does not automatically disqualify the patient from having a new PE? But note that the PERC criteria are for ruling out PE. If the patient has had a prior PE, then the risk of recurrence is higher, but PERC is not designed to be used in such patients? Actually, the PERC criteria are for patients without prior PE or DVT. The presence of a prior PE or DVT would make the patient ineligible for PERC because they are at higher risk. However, the note says: \"Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism\": True. But in this case, the patient is presenting with new symptoms and the CT shows new PE. So, we must be cautious.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me look at the PERC criteria as defined by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP). The PERC criteria are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Age ≥50 years\n",
      "2. Heart rate >100 beats per minute\n",
      "3. Oxygen saturation ≤95%\n",
      "4. Hemoptysis\n",
      "5. Previous DVT or PE\n",
      "\n",
      "If a patient has any of these, then PERC cannot be used to rule out PE. In fact, the presence of any of these criteria means that the patient should be investigated for PE.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case:\n",
      "- Age: 55 years → ≥50 → yes\n",
      "- Heart rate: 119 bpm → >100 → yes (note: this is the initial presentation)\n",
      "- O₂ saturation: 93% → ≤95% → yes\n",
      "- Hemoptysis: False → no\n",
      "- Previously documented PE: True → yes\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the patient meets at least three criteria (age, heart rate, and previously documented PE) and also meets the oxygen saturation criterion. So, the PERC score is not applicable because the patient has multiple risk factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the PERC score is a rule-out criteria, and if any of the five criteria are present, then the patient cannot be ruled out by PERC. Therefore, the PERC score in this case would be that the patient does not meet the criteria for a low-risk rule-out.\n",
      "\n",
      "But note: the patient was in the ER and the CT showed PE. So, we are not ruling out PE, but the PERC is not being used because the patient has multiple risk factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PERC score is calculated as the number of criteria that are met. But the PERC is a rule-out tool and if any criterion is positive, the patient should be investigated.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for this patient:\n",
      "- Age ≥50: yes (55)\n",

      "Therefore, the patient meets 4 criteria (age, HR, O2 sat, and previous PE). The fifth criterion (hemoptysis) is not met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the PERC score is 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "But note: the PERC criteria are for patients with acute symptoms and without prior PE? Actually, the presence of prior PE or DVT is one of the criteria for PERC and if present, the patient should not be used in the rule-out. So, the PERC score is 4.\n",

      "But let's double-check the guidelines. The PERC criteria are:\n",

The time since the diagnosis of malignancy is not specified, but we can assume it is within the past 6 months? The case says: \"status post induction chemotherapy with lineage switch to acute myelogenous leukemia\". This suggests that the acute myelogenous leukemia was diagnosed and treated (with induction chemotherapy and then stem cell transplant). The stem cell transplant was 11 months ago.

      "- Heart rate: 122 bpm (which is greater than 100, so included)\n",
      "- Recent surgery or trauma: The patient had surgery (exploratory laparotomy and total abdominal hysterectomy) on the same day as admission? Actually, the surgery was performed after the patient became obtunded and was intubated. The surgery was done on the day of admission? The timeline is:\n",

Actually, the surgery was done on the day she was admitted? Because she was admitted, then the next day she became obtunded and then the surgery was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The surgery was performed within 24 hours of admission? The note says: \"The patient's overall status continued to worsen the following day.\" meaning the next day after admission.

Actually, the note does not specify the exact time, but it was done on the same day as admission? Or the next day? The surgery was performed after the patient was admitted and then the next day she became obtunded and then they did surgery. So the surgery was done the day after admission? That is within 24 hours? Or up to 3 months? The PERC score includes \"recent surgery or trauma\" within 3 months. Since the surgery was done the day after admission, that is within 3 months (actually, within 24 hours). So we include recent surgery or trauma.\n",

      "- Malignancy: The patient is a G2P2 African American woman with fibroid uterus. The fibroid is described as a solitary leiomyoma and was removed. There is no mention of malignancy. The tumor markers (CEA, AFP, CA-125, inhibins A and B) were normal. So no malignancy.\n",

      "- Estrogen use: The patient is on oral estradiol for hormone replacement therapy after the surgery? But the question is about the time of admission. The note says: \"She was placed on oral estradiol for hormone replacement therapy\" after discharge? Actually, the surgery was done and she was discharged on POD-8. The hormone replacement was started after discharge. At the time of admission, she had a history of fibroids and no mention of estrogen use. The note says: \"The patient was placed on oral estradiol for hormone replacement therapy\" after discharge. So at the time of admission, she was not on estrogen. Therefore, estrogen use at the time of admission? The PERC score includes \"estrogen use\" (which may include oral contraceptives or hormone replacement). But the patient was not on estrogen at the time of admission. So we do not include.\n",
      "\n",
      "- History of DVT or PE: The note says \"Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism\": False, and \"Previously documented Deep Vein Thrombosis\": False. So no.\n",

      "Alternatively, the patient might have had dyspnea at some point? The note does not mention any respiratory symptoms. The vital signs on admission: oxygen saturation was 88% (which is low) but then increased to 94% on 2 liters of nasal oxygen. The respiratory rate was 31, which is tachypneic, but that might be due to hypoxia and shock. However, the primary complaint was abdominal pain. \n",

      "\n",
      "Alternatively, note that the PERC score is for ruling out PE. The patient in this case had a pelvic mass and was in septic shock. The surgery revealed a large fibroid. The pathology showed acute inflammation and degeneration. The patient was treated and improved. The question is: what is the PERC score? It is 0 because the patient did not have dyspnea.\n",

Since the X-ray only showed infiltrating shadows and not consolidation, we might not count it. However, note that the CT showed lobar pneumonia, but the PERC criteria are based on chest X-ray.

      " - Age: 29 years (so not ≥50)\n",
      " - Heart rate: initially 99 bpm, then 120 bpm (on the fifth day). The fifth day heart rate was 120 bpm.\n",
      " - O2 saturation: initially 99% on ambient air, then on the fifth day it was not mentioned but we know the patient had shock and shock often includes hypotension and altered mental status. However, the note does not report O2 saturation during the critical events. But note: during the initial presentation, O2 sat was 99%. We are to use the data provided. We don't have O2 saturation recorded during the critical events? Actually, the note does not report O2 saturation during the shock event. However, the patient was in shock and had abdominal guarding and rebound tenderness, but we don't have O2 sat during that time. Since the PERC criteria require O2 saturation ≤90%, and we don't have that data during the critical event, we cannot assign this criterion.\n",
      "\n",
      " - Hypotension: The initial BP was 159/100 (which is normal to high). On the fifth day, BP was 180/110 (also high) and then the patient developed shock. But note: the shock event was during the critical episode and we don't have O2 sat or BP readings during that time. However, the PERC criteria for hypotension is systolic BP <90 mmHg or diastolic <60 mmHg. The patient's BP at the time of the critical event is not recorded. Therefore, we cannot assign this criterion.\n",
      "\n",
      " - Recent surgery or trauma: False (the patient had no surgery or trauma in the last 4 weeks)\n",
      "\n",
      " - Malignancy: Not mentioned, so we assume false.\n",

The PERC score is a tool to help rule out community-acquired pneumonia in patients who are not febrile (or have a low-grade fever) and have no risk factors for pneumonia. The score is calculated by checking for the presence or absence of several clinical signs and symptoms.\n",

      "Note: The PERC score is used to rule out pneumonia in outpatients who are not febrile (or have a low-grade fever) and have no risk factors for pneumonia. It is not typically used in hospitalized patients or those with multiple risk factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in this case, the patient is a kidney transplant recipient on immunosuppressive therapy and is hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia. Therefore, the PERC score may not be the most appropriate tool here because the patient has significant risk factors (immunosuppression, kidney disease, heart failure, etc.) and is already admitted to the hospital for pneumonia. \n",
      "\n",
      "But since the question specifically asks for the PERC score, we will calculate it based on the available data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's review the patient's data:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Age**: 55 years (which is less than 65, so not >65)\n",
      "2. **Fever**: The patient had no fever at the time of initial presentation (Jan 31, 2020) and during the course (no fever reported until discharge). So, no fever >38.0°C.\n",
      "3. **Hypoxemia**: \n",
      "   - On Feb 8 (Day 0, Day 5), SpO2 was 94% on ambient air (which is below 93%, so hypoxemia).\n",
      "   - On Feb 12 (Day 4), dyspnea developed, but no specific SpO2 given at that time. However, the patient was in the ICU and on oxygen. We don't have the exact SpO2 at the time of admission (Feb 8) beyond the initial 94%.\n",
      "   - On Feb 20 (Day 12), SpO2 was 100% on 4 L/min oxygen. This does not reflect hypoxemia on room air.\n",
      "   - Since the PERC score requires hypoxemia on room air (SpO2 < 93% on room air) and we have an instance (Feb 8) with SpO2 94% on room air, we can count this as hypoxemia. However, note that the hypoxemia was transient and the patient improved with oxygen.\n",
      "   - But the PERC score is based on the initial presentation or the most severe episode? We should consider the most severe episode. However, the patient was admitted on Feb 8 and hypoxemia was present at that time (SpO2 94% on room air). So, we can note that the patient had hypoxemia on room air (SpO2 < 93%? 94% is above 93%, so not hypoxemic?).\n",
      "   - Correction: SpO2 of 94% is above 93%, so it does not meet the hypoxemia criterion (which requires SpO2 < 93% on room air). Therefore, we cannot count hypoxemia for PERC.\n",
      "\n",
      "   However, let's clarify the PERC criteria: \n",
      "   - Hypoxemia is defined as PaO2 < 70 mm Hg on room air or SpO2 < 93% on room air. \n",
      "   - The patient's SpO2 on Feb 8 was 94% on room air, which is above 93%. Therefore, hypoxemia is not present.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Leukopenia or Leukocytosis**:\n",
      "   - The patient had lymphocytopenia (low lymphocyte count) but no mention of total WBC count. The patient had elevated CRP and troponin, but these are not WBC. Without WBC count, we cannot determine leukopenia or leukocytosis. Therefore, we skip this.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Pleural effusion**: The CT showed bilateral lung interstitial disease with ground-glass opacities (GGO), but no mention of pleural effusion. So, we cannot count pleural effusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Recent surgery or trauma**: The patient has a history of kidney transplant (living) in 2013, but that was 7 years ago. The relevant entities note that there is no recent surgery or trauma. Also, the patient is not described as having any recent surgery or trauma. So, no.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **History of DVT or PE**: The patient has a history of heart failure and is on diuretics, but no history of DVT or PE. The relevant entities note that there is no history of DVT or PE. So, no.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs**: The patient is on immunosuppressive drugs (MMF, tacrolimus, methylprednisolone). Therefore, we can count this.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **History of malignancy or chronic renal disease**: The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is on dialysis? The note says \"chronic kidney disease for many years\" and \"creatinine levels were maintained at around 100 μmol/L most of the time\", but then increased to 180 μmol/L. However, the patient did not require dialysis (creatinine 180 μmol/L is not at end-stage; end-stage renal disease is usually >442 μmol/L). But the PERC score includes chronic renal disease as a risk factor. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, so we can count this.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **History of CHF or significant cardiac disease**: The patient has a history of heart failure and is on diuretics and other heart failure medications. So, we can count this.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Other risk factors**: The patient has a history of heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and is on immunosuppressive therapy. The PERC score also includes:\n",
      "    - Malignancy (not mentioned, so no)\n",
      "    - Congestive heart failure (CHF) or significant cardiac disease (yes, we have that)\n",
      "\n",
      "    But note: the PERC score does not include malignancy. So we have two risk factors: \n",
      "    - Use of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs (yes)\n",
      "    - History of chronic renal disease (yes)\n",
      "    - History of CHF (yes)\n",
      "\n",
      "    However, the PERC score counts each of these as separate risk factors? Actually, the score is the number of risk factors present. Each of these is a separate item.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Therefore, we have at least three risk factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "    - Use of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs: yes (counts as one)\n",
      "    - History of chronic renal disease: yes (counts as one)\n",
      "    - History of CHF: yes (counts as one)\n",
      "\n",
      "    So, we have 3 risk factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "But note: the PERC score requires the patient to be an outpatient and not have any of these risk factors to use the score. However, in this patient, we have multiple risk factors (immunosuppression, CKD, CHF) and is admitted to the hospital. Therefore, the PERC score is not appropriate to rule out pneumonia because the patient has significant risk factors. In fact, the patient was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia and had lung lesions. The PERC score is designed for low-risk outpatients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that the patient has multiple risk factors, the PERC score is not useful for ruling out pneumonia. However, we are asked to calculate the PERC score.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we will calculate the number of risk factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Use of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs: yes (1)\n",
      "- History of chronic renal disease: yes (1)\n",
      "- History of CHF: yes (1)\n",
      "\n",
      "That's three.\n",
      "\n",
      "But note: the PERC score does not include the following as risk factors in the original study? Actually, the original PERC score includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Age >65: no (age 55)\n",
      "- Fever >38.0°C: no (no fever)\n",
      "- Hypoxemia: no (SpO2 94% on room air is above 93%\n",

      "\n",
      "Let's go through each criterion and note whether it is met or not in this patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Age: The patient is 43 years old, which is less than 50 years. Therefore, the criterion \"age < 50 years\" is met. This criterion is negative (because it is met, meaning the patient does not have age >=50) so we count this as 1 point.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Heart rate: The patient's pulse is 103 beats per minute, which is above 100. Therefore, the criterion \"heart rate < 100 beats per minute\" is not met. This is a positive criterion (meaning the patient has a heart rate >=100) so we do not count it. The negative criterion (heart rate <100) is not present, so we don't add a point.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Oxygen saturation: The oxygen saturation is 93%, which is below 95%. Therefore, the criterion \"oxygen saturation >95%\" is not met. This is a positive criterion (oxygen saturation <=95) so we do not count it. The negative criterion (oxygen saturation >95) is not present, so we don't add a point.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Hemoptysis: The patient has hemoptysis (coughing up blood). Therefore, the criterion \"no hemoptysis\" is not met. This is a positive criterion (hemoptysis present) so we do not count it. The negative criterion (no hemoptysis) is not present, so we don't add a point.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Unilateral leg swelling: The left lower extremity is swollen and erythematous. Therefore, the criterion \"no unilateral leg swelling\" is not met. This is a positive criterion (unilateral leg swelling present) so we do not count it. The negative criterion (no unilateral leg swelling) is not present, so we don't add a point.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. History of DVT or PE: The patient has no previously documented deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Therefore, the criterion \"no history of DVT or PE\" is met. This criterion is negative (because it is met, meaning the patient does not have a history) so we count this as 1 point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's summarize the criteria that we counted (i.e., the negative criteria that are present):\n",

      "- Age <50: present (1 point)\n",
      "- Heart rate <100: absent (not counted)\n",

      "- No hemoptysis: absent (not counted)\n",
      "- No unilateral leg swelling: absent (not counted)\n",
      "- No history of DVT or PE: present (1 point)\n",
      "\n",
      "Total PERC score = 2 (from age and no history of DVT/PE)\n",
      "\n",

      "But note: The PERC score is defined as the number of criteria that are absent (i.e., the negative criteria that are true). We have two negative criteria that are true: age <50 and no history of DVT or PE. So the score is 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's important to note that the PERC score of 0 means the patient is not at risk for PE and does not require further testing. A score of 2 means that the patient meets two of the negative criteria (so they are at low risk) but we still need to consider the clinical context.\n",
      "\n",
      "But according to the PERC algorithm, a score of 0 to 1 indicates low risk and does not require further testing. A score of 2 or more may require further evaluation. However, the question is only to calculate the PERC score.\n",

      "Total: 2\n",

      "- Cyanosis\n",

Therefore, we are assessing the patient's condition at the time of surgery and recovery, but note that the PERC score is typically used in the immediate postoperative period (within 48 hours) to screen for PE. However, the patient in this case is only 1 hour and 45 minutes post-op and the recovery is uneventful. We are to use the PERC criteria as they are.\n",

      "Let's go through each criterion with the given information:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Pulseless electrical activity (PEA): The patient has a heart rate of 90 beats per minute and baseline blood pressure was 128/80 mmHg. There is no mention of PEA. So, this is negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Respiratory depression: The patient's oxygen saturation was 98% on room air and there was no significant variation in vitals during the operation. The pulmonary function test was suggestive of mild restrictive disease, but that is baseline and not acute respiratory depression. Also, the patient was able to maintain adequate oxygenation during the surgery. So, we do not have evidence of respiratory depression. Negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Cyanosis: The patient had blue sclerae, but that is a chronic finding and not acute cyanosis. The patient's oxygen saturation was 98% and there is no mention of cyanosis. Negative.\n",

      "4. Other:\n",
      "   - Hemoptysis: The patient did not have hemoptysis. Negative.\n",
      "   - Unilateral leg swelling: The patient had no unilateral leg swelling. Negative.\n",
      "   - Recent surgery or trauma: The patient had undergone surgery (nail removal) but note that the surgery was recent (within 48 hours). However, the PERC score is for patients who are at risk for PE. The patient has a history of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type I and has had multiple fractures and surgeries. But the PERC score does not automatically include recent surgery. The standard PERC criteria for a positive score do not include recent surgery as a criterion. However, note that the patient had surgery 1.75 hours ago. But the PERC criteria are for the immediate postoperative period (within 48 hours) and do not include recent surgery as a criterion for a positive PERC score. The criteria are the ones listed above. So, we do not include recent surgery in the PERC score calculation. Therefore, we mark it as negative for the purpose of PERC? Actually, the standard PERC criteria do not include recent surgery. Let me check the standard PERC criteria:\n",

      "   - Hemoptysis\n",
      "   - Unilateral leg swelling\n",
      "   - Recent surgery or trauma? (Note: some variations include recent surgery as a criterion, but the original PERC criteria do not. However, the modified version for postoperative patients does not include recent surgery as a criterion. The original PERC criteria were for preoperative patients and did not include recent surgery. The modified version for postoperative patients (which is what we are using here) does not include recent surgery as a criterion. So, we will not include it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "   Therefore, we do not consider recent surgery as a criterion for PERC in this context.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Hormone use: The patient did not use any hormones (as per the \"Hormone use\": False). Negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Previously documented pulmonary embolism: The patient has no history of PE. Negative.\n",
      "   - Previously documented deep vein thrombosis: The patient has no history of DVT. Negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, none of the criteria are met. The PERC score would be 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "But note: The patient is at high risk for PE due to her history of osteogenesis imperfecta (which is a known risk factor) and multiple surgeries. However, the PERC score is a screening tool and a score of 0 means that the patient is not at high risk for PE based on these criteria and therefore no further testing is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, note that the PERC criteria are for the immediate postoperative period (within 48 hours) and the patient is only 1.75 hours post-op. We are to base our score on the criteria.\n",
