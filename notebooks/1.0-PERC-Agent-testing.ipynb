      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 73-year-old female was brought by emergency medical services (EMS) to the emergency department (ED) after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). She was driving when her car crashed into a streetlamp at 40 miles per hour. The EMS team reported that the pole intruded into the passenger compartment and the patient required a prolonged extrication. She had a Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) of 11 when EMS arrived at the scene, which improved to a 15 after repeated evaluations. She was conscious, alert, and oriented at the scene and during transport.\n",
      "The patient had difficulty recalling the events before the collision. She remembered feeling “like I was having a panic attack” just before the crash, and she did not recall the car impacting the streetlamp. In the ED, she complained of substernal chest pressure. The patient’s history was limited due to her continued difficulty recalling the events of the accident. The patient’s son was contacted and he stated that she lives alone and is active and independent. He stated that she had experienced syncopal episodes over the last several years, all associated with paroxysms of panic when driving, and she had undergone extensive workups without any clear etiology identified. She had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain with and without contrast four years prior for stroke-like symptoms after a syncopal event. Per his report, no abnormalities were found.\n",
      "The patient had a past medical history of anxiety, migraines, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and hyperlipidemia. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, which was treated with a left mastectomy followed by five years of tamoxifen and letrozole treatment. She had a family history of dementia, diabetes, and heart disease. She denied using tobacco, alcohol, or illicit substances. She was prescribed, and was taking, the following medications: levothyroxine 25 micrograms daily; atorvastatin 20 milligrams (mg) nightly; rizatriptan 10 mg as needed for headaches; and multivitamins.\n",
      "On physical exam, the patient’s temperature was 36.5° Celsius, her heart rate was 92 beats per minute, and her blood pressure was 142/72 millimeters of mercury. She was breathing at a rate of 21 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She weighed 125 pounds and was 5 feet, 3 inches tall, with a body mass index of 22.1 kilograms per meter squared. She did not appear to be in any acute distress, was healthy appearing, and was oriented to her name, date, and location. Her head was normocephalic and atraumatic; she had no Battle sign, raccoon eyes, or other signs of trauma. She had hearing aids in place bilaterally. She had normal extraocular movements with equal pupils that were reactive to light. She had a cervical collar in place. Later, when it was safe to remove her collar, her neck had a normal range of motion without rigidity or pain.\n",
      "On auscultation, her heart had a regular S1 and S2 at a normal rate and was without murmurs. She had normal pulses bilaterally. Her lungs were clear without wheezing or rhonchi, and she was noted to have normal effort without respiratory distress. Her abdomen was soft and flat, without tenderness or guarding. Her musculoskeletal exam showed an overall normal range of motion without deformities. She had no step-offs of the spinous processes or tenderness along the midline spine. The remainder of her skeletal exam only revealed tenderness over the left wrist. She had a capillary refill of less than two seconds. On her skin exam, she had minor contusions to the left upper chest near the axilla with superficial abrasions along the left wrist. She was not diaphoretic.

      "A 73-year-old female was brought by emergency medical services (EMS) to the emergency department (ED) after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). She was driving when her car crashed into a streetlamp at 40 miles per hour. The EMS team reported that the pole intruded into the passenger compartment and the patient required a prolonged extrication. She had a Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) of 11 when EMS arrived at the scene, which improved to a 15 after repeated evaluations. She was conscious, alert, and oriented at the scene and during transport.\n",
      "The patient had difficulty recalling the events before the collision. She remembered feeling “like I was having a panic attack” just before the crash, and she did not recall the car impacting the streetlamp. In the ED, she complained of substernal chest pressure. The patient’s history was limited due to her continued difficulty recalling the events of the accident. The patient’s son was contacted and he stated that she lives alone and is active and independent. He stated that she had experienced syncopal episodes over the last several years, all associated with paroxysms of panic when driving, and she had undergone extensive workups without any clear etiology identified. She had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain with and without contrast four years prior for stroke-like symptoms after a syncopal event. Per his report, no abnormalities were found.\n",
      "The patient had a past medical history of anxiety, migraines, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and hyperlipidemia. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, which was treated with a left mastectomy followed by five years of tamoxifen and letrozole treatment. She had a family history of dementia, diabetes, and heart disease. She denied using tobacco, alcohol, or illicit substances. She was prescribed, and was taking, the following medications: levothyroxine 25 micrograms daily; atorvastatin 20 milligrams (mg) nightly; rizatriptan 10 mg as needed for headaches; and multivitamins.\n",
      "On physical exam, the patient’s temperature was 36.5° Celsius, her heart rate was 92 beats per minute, and her blood pressure was 142/72 millimeters of mercury. She was breathing at a rate of 21 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She weighed 125 pounds and was 5 feet, 3 inches tall, with a body mass index of 22.1 kilograms per meter squared. She did not appear to be in any acute distress, was healthy appearing, and was oriented to her name, date, and location. Her head was normocephalic and atraumatic; she had no Battle sign, raccoon eyes, or other signs of trauma. She had hearing aids in place bilaterally. She had normal extraocular movements with equal pupils that were reactive to light. She had a cervical collar in place. Later, when it was safe to remove her collar, her neck had a normal range of motion without rigidity or pain.\n",
      "On auscultation, her heart had a regular S1 and S2 at a normal rate and was without murmurs. She had normal pulses bilaterally. Her lungs were clear without wheezing or rhonchi, and she was noted to have normal effort without respiratory distress. Her abdomen was soft and flat, without tenderness or guarding. Her musculoskeletal exam showed an overall normal range of motion without deformities. She had no step-offs of the spinous processes or tenderness along the midline spine. The remainder of her skeletal exam only revealed tenderness over the left wrist. She had a capillary refill of less than two seconds. On her skin exam, she had minor contusions to the left upper chest near the axilla with superficial abrasions along the left wrist. She was not diaphoretic. Neurologically she had no cranial nerve deficits, with no motor weakness or sensory deficits peripherally. She had a normal gait and normal coordination as well. She could not recall her birth date and had slow verbalization with some word-finding difficulty. Psychiatrically, she was normal in mood and behavior.\n",

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 17-year-old female presented with 1-month history of more noticeable weight loss and increased tiredness. Over the last 6 years since immigrating to the United States with her family from Burma and going through puberty, her body habitus has changed to a very thin appearance. This period of time began with menarche, which subsequently demonstrated intermittent oligomenorrhea occasionally alternating with amenorrhea. Apparently, workup by a gynecologist was negative and a yearlong period of oral contraceptive use did little to change the scant flow pattern. She discontinued these 6 months ago. The patient’s diet history revealed 3 meals a day of normal type foods but always smaller portions than other members of her family. Mother agreed that she does not eat much fried or fast foods, usually what is prepared for the family at home. The patient eventually suggested after repetitive questions that there was an increase in early satiety over the last month and she clearly was overall more tired. Five months ago, she had an outpatient visit for viral syndrome with vomiting and diarrhea, which resolved in 48 hours. At that time, her weight was 42 kg and no fever noted. Review of systems was notable for fatigue, intermittent chills, hair loss with nonvigorous brushing, intermittent “shakiness” when getting up, and shortness of breath on exertion. She denied any fever, upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, coughing, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, abdominal pain other than associated with her menstrual cycle, rashes, easy bruising or bleeding. Her past medical history was notable for the oligomenorrhea and scoliosis, but prior testing for anemia reported negative 6 months ago, and all chronic diseases, including in other members of the family, was denied, including anemia, thalassemia, and tuberculosis. The patient reports feeling “sad sometimes” but denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. In the emergency department, her physical exam (PE) was notable for a tired appearing but otherwise well teenage girl with a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate 125, respiratory rate 16, pulse oxygenation saturation of 97% on room air, weight 40 kg, height 144.78 cm, body mass index 20.1, some hair loss with brushing, II/VI systolic murmur over LUSB, and mild nonpitting bilateral edema. The remainder of the PE was unremarkable. Laboratory values were remarkable for white blood cell count 4700/µL with neutrophilic predominance, hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL, hematocrit 24.8%, mean corpuscular volume 74.9 fL, red cell distribution width 18.4%. Chemistry panel was within normal limits except for low albumin 2.9 g/dL, and a slightly elevated aspartate transaminase 54 U/L. Thyroid studies demonstrated slightly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone of 6.68 mIU/L (05-6.0) with normal free T4 of 1.08 ng/dL (0.7-1.9). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated to 65.4 mg/L (normal 0-5) and 132 mm/h (normal 0-20), respectively. Urinalysis was unremarkable and urine pregnancy test was negative. Additional iron studies demonstrated levels of iron 29 µg/dL, ferritin 3 ng/mL, and a total iron binding capacity of 144 µg/dL. Given the severe anemia and elevated inflammatory markers, the decision was made to admit the patient for further workup.\n",

      "A 17-year-old female presented with 1-month history of more noticeable weight loss and increased tiredness. Over the last 6 years since immigrating to the United States with her family from Burma and going through puberty, her body habitus has changed to a very thin appearance. This period of time began with menarche, which subsequently demonstrated intermittent oligomenorrhea occasionally alternating with amenorrhea. Apparently, workup by a gynecologist was negative and a yearlong period of oral contraceptive use did little to change the scant flow pattern. She discontinued these 6 months ago. The patient’s diet history revealed 3 meals a day of normal type foods but always smaller portions than other members of her family. Mother agreed that she does not eat much fried or fast foods, usually what is prepared for the family at home. The patient eventually suggested after repetitive questions that there was an increase in early satiety over the last month and she clearly was overall more tired. Five months ago, she had an outpatient visit for viral syndrome with vomiting and diarrhea, which resolved in 48 hours. At that time, her weight was 42 kg and no fever noted. Review of systems was notable for fatigue, intermittent chills, hair loss with nonvigorous brushing, intermittent “shakiness” when getting up, and shortness of breath on exertion. She denied any fever, upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, coughing, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, abdominal pain other than associated with her menstrual cycle, rashes, easy bruising or bleeding. Her past medical history was notable for the oligomenorrhea and scoliosis, but prior testing for anemia reported negative 6 months ago, and all chronic diseases, including in other members of the family, was denied, including anemia, thalassemia, and tuberculosis. The patient reports feeling “sad sometimes” but denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. In the emergency department, her physical exam (PE) was notable for a tired appearing but otherwise well teenage girl with a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate 125, respiratory rate 16, pulse oxygenation saturation of 97% on room air, weight 40 kg, height 144.78 cm, body mass index 20.1, some hair loss with brushing, II/VI systolic murmur over LUSB, and mild nonpitting bilateral edema. The remainder of the PE was unremarkable. Laboratory values were remarkable for white blood cell count 4700/µL with neutrophilic predominance, hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL, hematocrit 24.8%, mean corpuscular volume 74.9 fL, red cell distribution width 18.4%. Chemistry panel was within normal limits except for low albumin 2.9 g/dL, and a slightly elevated aspartate transaminase 54 U/L. Thyroid studies demonstrated slightly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone of 6.68 mIU/L (05-6.0) with normal free T4 of 1.08 ng/dL (0.7-1.9). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated to 65.4 mg/L (normal 0-5) and 132 mm/h (normal 0-20), respectively. Urinalysis was unremarkable and urine pregnancy test was negative. Additional iron studies demonstrated levels of iron 29 µg/dL, ferritin 3 ng/mL, and a total iron binding capacity of 144 µg/dL. Given the severe anemia and elevated inflammatory markers, the decision was made to admit the patient for further workup.\n",

He was recently started on pazopanib for systemic treatment of metastatic RCC. Pazopanib was started at 75% of the recommended dose. At the initiation of therapy, the patient had a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL and was able to walk 90 min a day without any complaints.\n",
      "Within the first week of starting pazopanib, the patient developed dyspnoea on exertion that progressed rapidly to dyspnoea on minimal exertion. He was no longer able to conduct his daily walks. On the 10th day after starting pazopanib, he was unable to shave himself due to dyspnoea, which prompted his ED presentation. In the ED, his blood pressure (BP) was 122/70 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) was 93 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate (RR) was 22 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. On physical examination, auscultation of the heart was significant for an irregular rhythm with no additional heart sounds or signs of volume overload.

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 71-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension presented to our community emergency department (ED) transported by emergency medical services (EMS) with the chief complaints of chest pain, difficulty breathing, back pain, and weakness of both lower extremities. He had an abrupt onset of chest pain, described as a sharp and stabbing pain, while using his rototiller in the garden, 6 h prior to arrival. His symptoms continued to progress to the point that he was having difficulty breathing and starting to have trouble walking for which EMS was called. Per EMS, they noted rapidly progressing symptoms while en route to the ED. Vitals on arrival to the ED are as follows: 94.5 °F, blood pressure of 91/64 mmHg, heart rate of 109 beats/min, respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min, and 100% pulse oximetry on room air. On physical exam, he was toxic appearing, in acute distress, and diaphoretic. Jugular venous distention was present. Cardiopulmonary exam was notable for tachycardia, distant heart sounds, and the presence of bibasilar rales. His skin/lower extremities were pale, mottled, and he was unable to move them. Carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally, radial pules 1+ bilaterally, femoral pulses 1+ bilaterally, with absent popliteal pulses. On neurological exam, he had dysarthric speech, left-sided facial droop, and loss of strength and sensation in his lower extremities.\n",
      "The patient was placed on non-invasive positive pressure. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia with premature atrial complexes, a right bundle branch block, with non-specific ST/T wave changes in the anterior leads. Portable chest radiography taken in an upright position (Fig. ) demonstrated a widened mediastinum at about 10.5 cm. A bedside point of care cardiac ultrasound revealed a significant pericardial effusion. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast was unremarkable for any acute process. Pertinent laboratory evaluation:\n",
      "Hemoglobin of 9.2 (13.5–17 g/dL) Arterial blood gas: pH 7.01, pCO2 45, p02 116, HCO3 12 Initial lactic acid of 8.3 (0.5–2.2 mmol/L) that increased to 14.8 Blood/urea/nitrogen of 42 (8–22 mg/dL) Creatinine of 3.06 (0.6–1.4 mg/dL).\n",
      "CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast revealed a Stanford type A dissection with an intimal tear beginning at the level of the aortic root and extending throughout the course of the thoracic aorta and into the abdominal aorta (Figs. , , and ). Additional findings on CT included involvement of the origins of the great vessels (brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery). Hemopericardium is visualized with high suspicion for pericardial tamponade. There is dilation of the ascending thoracic aorta measuring up to 5.2 cm. The dissection continues distally (Figs. and ) to involve the left common iliac artery and bilateral external iliac arteries.\n",
      "He was transferred emergently to a tertiary center and was taken immediately to the operating room for definitive repair. The patient underwent sternotomy, repair of Stanford type A dissection with right groin cannulation, and repair of the right femoral artery and vein. He arrived in the surgical intensive care unit in guarded condition, his sternotomy was left open secondary to severe coagulopathy intraoperatively, and he was on an epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin infusion. By day 2, continuous renal replacement therapy (CCRT) was initiated for acute tubular necrosis. Vascular surgery was consulted to evaluate a pulseless right lower extremity status post right femoral artery cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass. Given the patient had an open sternotomy with five chest tubes with significant output requiring transfusion of multiple blood products throughout the night, vascular surgery could not perform a femoral-femoral bypass or axillofemoral bypass without heparinization.\n",
      "By day 3, he underwent mediastinal irrigation and sternal closure with cardiothoracic surgery. He was then taken for a right common femoral endarterectomy, iliofemoral and lower extremity embolectomy, and right lower extremity four-compartment fasciotomy secondary to acute ischemia of the right lower extremity. In addition, neurosurgery evaluated the patient because he was not spontaneously moving his extremities after surgery and there was concern that the dissection had caused an infarction of his thoracic spinal cord, resulting in paraplegia. By day 4, he remained stuporous off sedation and on maximum pressor support (norepinephrine infusion at 30 mcg/min, epinephrine infusion at 10 mcg/min, and a vasopressin infusion at 0.04 units/min). He continued to have upper extremity non-epileptic myoclonic jerks secondary to continued renal failure.

      "A 71-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension presented to our community emergency department (ED) transported by emergency medical services (EMS) with the chief complaints of chest pain, difficulty breathing, back pain, and weakness of both lower extremities. He had an abrupt onset of chest pain, described as a sharp and stabbing pain, while using his rototiller in the garden, 6 h prior to arrival. His symptoms continued to progress to the point that he was having difficulty breathing and starting to have trouble walking for which EMS was called. Per EMS, they noted rapidly progressing symptoms while en route to the ED. Vitals on arrival to the ED are as follows: 94.5 °F, blood pressure of 91/64 mmHg, heart rate of 109 beats/min, respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min, and 100% pulse oximetry on room air. On physical exam, he was toxic appearing, in acute distress, and diaphoretic. Jugular venous distention was present. Cardiopulmonary exam was notable for tachycardia, distant heart sounds, and the presence of bibasilar rales. His skin/lower extremities were pale, mottled, and he was unable to move them. Carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally, radial pules 1+ bilaterally, femoral pulses 1+ bilaterally, with absent popliteal pulses. On neurological exam, he had dysarthric speech, left-sided facial droop, and loss of strength and sensation in his lower extremities.\n",
      "The patient was placed on non-invasive positive pressure. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia with premature atrial complexes, a right bundle branch block, with non-specific ST/T wave changes in the anterior leads. Portable chest radiography taken in an upright position (Fig. ) demonstrated a widened mediastinum at about 10.5 cm. A bedside point of care cardiac ultrasound revealed a significant pericardial effusion. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast was unremarkable for any acute process. Pertinent laboratory evaluation:\n",
      "Hemoglobin of 9.2 (13.5–17 g/dL) Arterial blood gas: pH 7.01, pCO2 45, p02 116, HCO3 12 Initial lactic acid of 8.3 (0.5–2.2 mmol/L) that increased to 14.8 Blood/urea/nitrogen of 42 (8–22 mg/dL) Creatinine of 3.06 (0.6–1.4 mg/dL).\n",
      "CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast revealed a Stanford type A dissection with an intimal tear beginning at the level of the aortic root and extending throughout the course of the thoracic aorta and into the abdominal aorta (Figs. , , and ). Additional findings on CT included involvement of the origins of the great vessels (brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery). Hemopericardium is visualized with high suspicion for pericardial tamponade. There is dilation of the ascending thoracic aorta measuring up to 5.2 cm. The dissection continues distally (Figs. and ) to involve the left common iliac artery and bilateral external iliac arteries.\n",
      "He was transferred emergently to a tertiary center and was taken immediately to the operating room for definitive repair. The patient underwent sternotomy, repair of Stanford type A dissection with right groin cannulation, and repair of the right femoral artery and vein. He arrived in the surgical intensive care unit in guarded condition, his sternotomy was left open secondary to severe coagulopathy intraoperatively, and he was on an epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin infusion. By day 2, continuous renal replacement therapy (CCRT) was initiated for acute tubular necrosis. Vascular surgery was consulted to evaluate a pulseless right lower extremity status post right femoral artery cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass. Given the patient had an open sternotomy with five chest tubes with significant output requiring transfusion of multiple blood products throughout the night, vascular surgery could not perform a femoral-femoral bypass or axillofemoral bypass without heparinization.\n",
      "By day 3, he underwent mediastinal irrigation and sternal closure with cardiothoracic surgery. He was then taken for a right common femoral endarterectomy, iliofemoral and lower extremity embolectomy, and right lower extremity four-compartment fasciotomy secondary to acute ischemia of the right lower extremity. In addition, neurosurgery evaluated the patient because he was not spontaneously moving his extremities after surgery and there was concern that the dissection had caused an infarction of his thoracic spinal cord, resulting in paraplegia. By day 4, he remained stuporous off sedation and on maximum pressor support (norepinephrine infusion at 30 mcg/min, epinephrine infusion at 10 mcg/min, and a vasopressin infusion at 0.04 units/min). He continued to have upper extremity non-epileptic myoclonic jerks secondary to continued renal failure. CT of the head revealed multiple 1 to 2 cm foci consistent with likely subacute infarcts related to embolic disease. By day 5, a family discussion was had regarding a poor neurological prognosis for independent neurological recovery with likely permanent cognitive and motor deficits. His code status was subsequently changed to do not resuscitate (DNR) with no further escalation of care. The patient continued to deteriorate throughout the night, became asystolic, and expired.\n",

However, the patient did undergo surgery as part of their treatment. Given the context, it seems the criterion of \"no recent trauma or surgery\" might be considered not met (false) due to the surgical intervention, but based on the initial presentation, we might lean towards it being met (true) if we strictly interpret \"recent trauma\" as external injury. Since the patient note does mention surgery as part of the treatment and not as a cause, and given the emphasis on recent trauma, we will consider this criterion as met (true) for the purpose of this evaluation, focusing on the absence of pre-hospital trauma.\n",

      "A 37-year-old male visited the emergency department at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, presenting with a chief complaint of dyspnea. Initial symptoms had begun 1 week prior to his visit, characterized by fever and chills, followed by progressive respiratory difficulty. He appeared acutely ill. A crackling sound was heard upon chest examination. His heartbeat was regular without a murmur. A purplish discoloration of the right ankle was observed, but there were no local heat or tenderness. Initial blood pressure was 163/91 mmHg, pulse rate was 114 beats/min, respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min, and body temperature was 38℃. Oxygen saturation was initially detected as 87%, and increased to 95% upon oxygen supplement via nasal cannula at 5 L/min. Following oxygen supplementation, arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40.9 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 113.7 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%.\n",
      "Laboratory tests revealed peripheral eosinophilia and thrombocytopenia with a white blood cell count of 22,580/µL (50% neutrophils, 31% eosinophils, 10% lymphocytes), Hb levels at 13.7 g/dL, and a platelet count of 26,000/µL. Prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times were 15 sec, and 35.4 sec respectively. Fibrinogen levels were within the normal range, but the concentration of D-dimer was markedly elevated at 26.69 µg/mL. Serum total IgE and ECP levels (939.4 IU/mL and 201.0 ng/mL, respectively) were both elevated, too. Tests for both anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. A test for parasites in the stool and serum were negative. Bone marrow biopsy showed normal cellularity with increased eosinophils. Fip1-like1 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFRA) gene fusion was not detected. Patchy consolidation with ground-glass opacity in both lower lung zones was noticed in the initial chest radiography ().\n",

      "A 56-year-old man was admitted to our institution with an 11-day history of persistent dry cough, fever, and progressive shortness of breath. On arrival at the hospital, he was hypoxemic, with a SpO2 of 91% and a respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute requiring ambient oxygen therapy with a flow of 15 L/min via a non-rebreather mask. Hemodynamically, he showed a stable profile with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 84 bpm. His body temperature was 38.1°C. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated C-reactive protein concentration of 37 mg/L (reference: <5 mg/L), a leukocyte count of 7.7 × 109/L (reference: 4–10 × 109/L) and D-dimer of 0.41 mg/L (reference: <0.50 mg/L).

      "A 38-year-old Caribbean-Black (Afro-Trinidadian) female with a medical history of endometriosis, intermittently adherent with the oral contraceptive pill, initially presented to the adult emergency department with acute dyspnea during the preceding 2 days. Her vital signs reflected systolic blood pressures of 142 mm Hg, heart rate of 112 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Her physical examination revealed a mildly elevated jugular venous pulse (10 cm of water), right chest stony dullness, no peripheral edema, and active menses.\n",
      "A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with an incomplete right bundle branch block, right ventricular hypertrophy, and subtle secondary ST-T segment changes (see ). A portable chest radiograph revealed a large-sized, right pleural effusion with mild perihilar congestion (see ). Pertinent diagnostic laboratory investigations included a D-dimer 208 ng/dL (normal ≤500 ng/mL), pro–brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) 323 pg/mL (normal ≤300 pg/mL), cardiac troponin I (cTnI) 0.08 ng/mL (normal = 0.0-0.15 ng/mL). The patient’s arterial blood gas was consistent with mild hypoxia on 24% fractional inspiration of oxygen (FiO2) with an alveolar-arterial gradient (A-a gradient) of 14 mm Hg.\n",
      "The patient was subsequently admitted for an inpatient hospitalization, and computed tomography (CT)-guided therapeutic thoracentesis was performed with a resultant hemorrhagic exudative effusion. Despite this intervention, the pleural effusion recurred within 48 hours, and cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) pleural biopsy, which later affirmed the presence of endometrial tissue on clinicopathological examination. The tentative diagnosis at this juncture was recurrent catamenial pleural effusions. On further interview, the patient acknowledged that she often experienced dyspneic episodes during menstruation.\n",
      "During the ensuing hospitalization, she continued to experience persistent shortness of breath with an episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). A 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed preserved left ventricular function with moderate right heart enlargement, septal flattening, and mild pHTN with estimated right ventricular systolic pressures of approximately 45 mm Hg. A 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiogram (2D/3D-TEE) also revealed an intact interatrial septum with agitated saline “bubble” study. The PVs were incompletely visualized and hence the rationale for further advanced imaging (see ). A cardiac CT angiogram (CCTA) affirmed the presence of the suspected PAPVC of the left inferior PV to the left brachiocephalic (innominate) vein with angiographically normal coronary arteries (see ). The patient also underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI), which demonstrated the same aberrant connection with the remaining pulmonary venous vasculature appearing dilated in addition to the RA, right ventricle, and main pulmonary artery (see and , respectively). Left heart catheterization established angiographically normal coronary arteries with right heart catheterization revealing a significant hemodynamic left-to-right shunt with Qp:Qs ratio of 3:1, mild pHTN, and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (see for a summary of the pertinent cardiovascular investigations).\n",

Since pregnancy itself is a natural state and not considered \"hormone use\" in the same context as taking contraceptive pills, and there's no explicit mention of exogenous hormone use, we might interpret this criterion as met (true) based on the strict definition of \"hormone use\" in medical contexts.

      "A 45-year-old woman with a 3-year history of chronic anemia was followed up at the Gastroenterology outpatient department of another hospital, with a 6-month history of abdominal pain. The pain was intermittent, worse in the mornings, and localized to the epigastric region. The patient noticed that her abdomen became distended after meals and distension was relieved after a bowel movement. The patient noticed a 12-kg weight loss over the last 6 months. There was a history of nausea but no vomiting. The patient denied any history of loss of appetite, diarrhea or constipation, and upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding. There was no significant past medical history other than anemia and multiple blood transfusions. The patient denied any history of tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, drug abuse, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, chronic renal failure, peptic ulcer disease, and chronic pancreatitis. Her family history was unremarkable. The patient did not have any prior surgeries or history of malignancy. Workup for her chronic anemia included CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast, which revealed duodenal intussusception. The patient was booked for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in the referral hospital but missed her appointment and asked for a referral to another hospital.\n",
      "Upon arrival at our hospital, she appeared underweight (height, 162 cm; weight, 43 kg). Her vitals were stable, and she was afebrile (blood pressure, 118/67 mm/Hg; heart rate, 96 bpm; respiratory rate, 23 bpm; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; temperature: 36.9 °C). On examination, her abdomen was soft and laxative, with no tenderness, or organomegaly. A complete blood count on the day of admission revealed the following: low hemoglobin level, 7.2 g/dL (12.0–17.0 g/dL); mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 78.0 fL (80.0–100.0 fL); low hematocrit, 24.8% (40.0%–51.0%); leukocyte count, 8.2 × 109/L (4.5-11.0 × 109/L); and platelet count, 323 × 109/L (150-450 × 109/L). Other laboratory profiles were unremarkable. Contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed significant dilation of the stomach with no detectable gastric lesion. The third part of the duodenum was distended by a sausage-shaped intraluminal structure with alternating fat planes and dilated vessels reaching up to the first part of the duodenum, suggesting retrograde jejuno-duodenal intussusception. There was no detectable soft tissue lesion, and the rest of the bowel was unremarkable (A–C). Endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract revealed a large, long, mobile submucosal longitudinal and tortuous bulge extending from the first to the second part of the duodenum that moved freely with bowel contraction. The papilla of Vater was normal with no neoplastic process.\n",
      "The patient underwent laparoscopic exploration, which revealed antiperistaltic intussusception in the proximal jejunum (). A jejunostomy was performed, and the mass was pulled through in the proximal jejunum (A).\n",
      "A cholecystectomy was performed, and a pediatric feeding tube was passed through the cystic duct to locate the ampulla of Vater. The mass was not resectable without affecting the ampulla, so the decision was made to perform a pancreas-sparing duodenal resection. The excised duodenum with mass was sent for histopathological examination (B).\n",
      "Pathological findings showed a large polypoid mass with the mucosa pedunculated from the bowel lumen, measuring 12 × 7.5 × 2.0 cm3. Microscopic examination revealed a bowel mucosa with underlying submucosa showing lobules of benign normal-appearing Brunner's glands separated by fibrous stroma. The nodular proliferation of Brunner glands was accompanied by cystically dilated ducts and adipose tissue with no microscopic features of malignancy (A–C). The patient was discharged postoperatively in good condition, given an appointment after 1 month.\n",

      "A 45-year-old woman with a 3-year history of chronic anemia was followed up at the Gastroenterology outpatient department of another hospital, with a 6-month history of abdominal pain. The pain was intermittent, worse in the mornings, and localized to the epigastric region. The patient noticed that her abdomen became distended after meals and distension was relieved after a bowel movement. The patient noticed a 12-kg weight loss over the last 6 months. There was a history of nausea but no vomiting. The patient denied any history of loss of appetite, diarrhea or constipation, and upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding. There was no significant past medical history other than anemia and multiple blood transfusions. The patient denied any history of tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, drug abuse, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, chronic renal failure, peptic ulcer disease, and chronic pancreatitis. Her family history was unremarkable. The patient did not have any prior surgeries or history of malignancy. Workup for her chronic anemia included CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast, which revealed duodenal intussusception. The patient was booked for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in the referral hospital but missed her appointment and asked for a referral to another hospital.\n",
      "Upon arrival at our hospital, she appeared underweight (height, 162 cm; weight, 43 kg). Her vitals were stable, and she was afebrile (blood pressure, 118/67 mm/Hg; heart rate, 96 bpm; respiratory rate, 23 bpm; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; temperature: 36.9 °C). On examination, her abdomen was soft and laxative, with no tenderness, or organomegaly. A complete blood count on the day of admission revealed the following: low hemoglobin level, 7.2 g/dL (12.0–17.0 g/dL); mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 78.0 fL (80.0–100.0 fL); low hematocrit, 24.8% (40.0%–51.0%); leukocyte count, 8.2 × 109/L (4.5-11.0 × 109/L); and platelet count, 323 × 109/L (150-450 × 109/L). Other laboratory profiles were unremarkable. Contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed significant dilation of the stomach with no detectable gastric lesion. The third part of the duodenum was distended by a sausage-shaped intraluminal structure with alternating fat planes and dilated vessels reaching up to the first part of the duodenum, suggesting retrograde jejuno-duodenal intussusception. There was no detectable soft tissue lesion, and the rest of the bowel was unremarkable (A–C). Endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract revealed a large, long, mobile submucosal longitudinal and tortuous bulge extending from the first to the second part of the duodenum that moved freely with bowel contraction. The papilla of Vater was normal with no neoplastic process.\n",
      "The patient underwent laparoscopic exploration, which revealed antiperistaltic intussusception in the proximal jejunum (). A jejunostomy was performed, and the mass was pulled through in the proximal jejunum (A).\n",
      "A cholecystectomy was performed, and a pediatric feeding tube was passed through the cystic duct to locate the ampulla of Vater. The mass was not resectable without affecting the ampulla, so the decision was made to perform a pancreas-sparing duodenal resection. The excised duodenum with mass was sent for histopathological examination (B).\n",
      "Pathological findings showed a large polypoid mass with the mucosa pedunculated from the bowel lumen, measuring 12 × 7.5 × 2.0 cm3. Microscopic examination revealed a bowel mucosa with underlying submucosa showing lobules of benign normal-appearing Brunner's glands separated by fibrous stroma. The nodular proliferation of Brunner glands was accompanied by cystically dilated ducts and adipose tissue with no microscopic features of malignancy (A–C). The patient was discharged postoperatively in good condition, given an appointment after 1 month.\n",

Finally, a generous Teflon felt patch was sewn over all previous patches to reinforce adhesion and avoid blood oozing (). The aortic cross-clamp was released, and the patient was weaned from CPB after normothermia with normal sinus rhythm, epinephrine, and insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump. The CPB and aortic cross-clamp times were 112 and 47 minutes, respectively. No bleeding occurred during the follow-up period.\n",
      "The patient was alive and had a good clinical status 12 months later. Postoperative and follow-up transesophageal echocardiography showed normal left and right ventricular size (LVEF of 30% - 35%) without pseudo-aneurysm. All apical, inferoseptal, and anteroseptal segments showed akinesia. Echocardiography also revealed anterior hypokinesia. There was no ventricular septal defect. The pericardium was normal without any effusion.\n",

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 28-year-old man was admitted in our hospital on Jul 13, 2018 because of recurrent cough and yellow-phlegm accompanied by fever for more than 10 months. The symptoms were repeated after routine symptomatic treatment. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan taken in January 2018 had showed that his right lung was spotted by small piece of shadow, accompanied by a cavity. The patient refused to initiate antitubercular therapy. The symptoms were improved after self-administration of cephalosporin as anti-infection treatment for 1 week. In May, the cough and sputum were aggravated, accompanied by fever in the afternoon, with body temperature around 38 °C. In the beginning of July, chest CT showed that the patchy shadow was scattered in two lungs with multiple cavities. The large consolidation in the right upper lung was significantly progressed compared with half a year ago. Considering combination of pulmonary tuberculosis and pulmonary infection, he was hospitalized.\n",
      "At admission, physical examination revealed the following: weight 53 kg; BMI 16.7, body temperature 38.7 °C, pulse 85/min, blood pressure 118/72 mmHg, finger oxygen saturation degree (FOSD) 98%. The lungs had lower breath sounds, with no obvious dry or wet rale. The auxiliary examination showed that the following test items were normal, including blood routine, biochemistry, coagulation, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, arterial blood gas analysis and echocardiography. D-dimer was 13.17 mg/L. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. The details of chest CT was shown in Fig. . Acid-fast bacilli staining test for sputum sample was positive (4+/3+), which confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.\n",
      "Routine anti-tuberculosis regimen was initiated, including isoniazid (300 mg/day), rifampin (450 mg/day), pyrazinamide (1500 mg/day) and ethambutol (750 mg/day). After 3 days of treatment, the body temperature dropped down to the normal, and the cough was relieved. Respiratory symptoms were also improved after 15 days of treatment. At that time, the patient suddenly felt chest tightness, chest pain, and shortness of breath after increased activity (three times more than the usual). Physical examination revealed: heart beats 138/m, blood pressure 88/58 mmHg, FOSD 86%. Even after 6 L high-flow oxygen intake, FOSD was maintained at 90%. Arterial blood gas analysis without oxygen inhalation indicated: pH 7.44, PO2 48 mmHg, PCO2 33 mmHg, SPO2 86%, Oxygenation Index 228.57 mmHg, D-dimer 14.03 mg/L. Electrocardiogram showed atrial tachycardia, non-specific ST elevation. Taking together, all the data highly suggested PTE. Emergency computer tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) inspection showed signs of filling defects in the trunk and branches of the left pulmonary artery and the right lower pulmonary artery (Fig. ).\n",
      "According to the CTPA result, the patient was diagnosed as a large-scale PTE, and the risk stratification was medium-high. The patient was prescribed with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (0.1 mL/10 kg) for anticoagulation. Then, under pulmonary angiography, a combined thrombolytic therapy including mechanical thrombolysis, aspiration, and topical urokinase (300,000 U) was applied to the left pulmonary artery. Fortunately, as shown in Fig. , the filling defect of left pulmonary artery disappeared. After the interventional therapy, the patient received intravenous pumping of 20,000 U urokinase every 1 h for 24 h. The symptoms of chest tightness, chest pain and shortness of breath were significantly improved, while the blood oxygen saturation and blood pressure returned to normal, and the vital signs were stable. Neither hemoptysis nor gastrointestinal bleeding occurred during the period of thrombolysis. The deep vein B-ultrasound of double lower limbs was performed and found a flocculent echo in the superior cavity of the upper right femoral vein, and extended into the external iliac vein. Then protein C, protein S activity, coagulation factor V leiden mutation, prothrombin 20210A, lupus anticoagulant, homocysteine, were determined and no abnormality was found. Anti-tuberculosis and warfarin anticoagulant therapy were continued, and international normalized ratio (INR) value was monitored and adjusted between 2 and 3. The patient was discharged with self-administration of oral anti-TB drugs and anticoagulant drug. At follow-up after 20 days of discharge, B-ultrasound showed that the deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of right lower extremity of the patient disappeared. At follow-up of 4 months, the patient was re-examined with chest enhanced CT in the outpatient department of our hospital and no obvious emboli was found.\n",

      "A 28-year-old man was admitted in our hospital on Jul 13, 2018 because of recurrent cough and yellow-phlegm accompanied by fever for more than 10 months. The symptoms were repeated after routine symptomatic treatment. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan taken in January 2018 had showed that his right lung was spotted by small piece of shadow, accompanied by a cavity. The patient refused to initiate antitubercular therapy. The symptoms were improved after self-administration of cephalosporin as anti-infection treatment for 1 week. In May, the cough and sputum were aggravated, accompanied by fever in the afternoon, with body temperature around 38 °C. In the beginning of July, chest CT showed that the patchy shadow was scattered in two lungs with multiple cavities. The large consolidation in the right upper lung was significantly progressed compared with half a year ago. Considering combination of pulmonary tuberculosis and pulmonary infection, he was hospitalized.\n",
      "At admission, physical examination revealed the following: weight 53 kg; BMI 16.7, body temperature 38.7 °C, pulse 85/min, blood pressure 118/72 mmHg, finger oxygen saturation degree (FOSD) 98%. The lungs had lower breath sounds, with no obvious dry or wet rale. The auxiliary examination showed that the following test items were normal, including blood routine, biochemistry, coagulation, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, arterial blood gas analysis and echocardiography. D-dimer was 13.17 mg/L. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. The details of chest CT was shown in Fig. . Acid-fast bacilli staining test for sputum sample was positive (4+/3+), which confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.\n",
      "Routine anti-tuberculosis regimen was initiated, including isoniazid (300 mg/day), rifampin (450 mg/day), pyrazinamide (1500 mg/day) and ethambutol (750 mg/day). After 3 days of treatment, the body temperature dropped down to the normal, and the cough was relieved. Respiratory symptoms were also improved after 15 days of treatment. At that time, the patient suddenly felt chest tightness, chest pain, and shortness of breath after increased activity (three times more than the usual). Physical examination revealed: heart beats 138/m, blood pressure 88/58 mmHg, FOSD 86%. Even after 6 L high-flow oxygen intake, FOSD was maintained at 90%. Arterial blood gas analysis without oxygen inhalation indicated: pH 7.44, PO2 48 mmHg, PCO2 33 mmHg, SPO2 86%, Oxygenation Index 228.57 mmHg, D-dimer 14.03 mg/L. Electrocardiogram showed atrial tachycardia, non-specific ST elevation. Taking together, all the data highly suggested PTE. Emergency computer tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) inspection showed signs of filling defects in the trunk and branches of the left pulmonary artery and the right lower pulmonary artery (Fig. ).\n",
      "According to the CTPA result, the patient was diagnosed as a large-scale PTE, and the risk stratification was medium-high. The patient was prescribed with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (0.1 mL/10 kg) for anticoagulation. Then, under pulmonary angiography, a combined thrombolytic therapy including mechanical thrombolysis, aspiration, and topical urokinase (300,000 U) was applied to the left pulmonary artery.

      "1. **Age < 50 years**: The patient is 28 years old, which is less than 50. Therefore, this criterion is met (true).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Heart rate < 100 beats per minute**: Initially, the patient's pulse was 85/min, which is less than 100. However, later it is mentioned that the heart beats were 138/m, which exceeds 100. Since the criterion is not consistently met, especially during the critical period of evaluation for PE, we consider this criterion not met (false).\n",

      "3. **Oxygen saturation ≥ 95%**: The patient's finger oxygen saturation degree (FOSD) was initially 98%, which is greater than or equal to 95%. However, it dropped to 86% and later improved to 90% with oxygen intake. The initial value meets the criterion, but the subsequent drop indicates a period where this criterion was not met. Given the context, we focus on the initial presentation and stability, thus considering this criterion met (true) based on the initial high saturation level.\n",

      "4. **No unilateral leg swelling**: There is no mention of unilateral leg swelling in the patient note. Therefore, we assume this criterion is met (true).\n",

At the time of initial evaluation, there was no known history of DVT or PE. Thus, considering the context of initial evaluation, we might initially consider this criterion as met (true), but given the development of DVT, it's a bit complex. For the purpose of PERC score calculation at the initial presentation, we'll consider it as met (true) because the DVT was diagnosed later.\n",

There was a soft systolic murmur in the right upper sternal border. Pulsation on dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery and sensation on right lower extremity was decreased. Electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed complete heart block with junctional escape rhythm and ST elevation in anterior precordial leads with ST depression in leads I and aVL (Figure ). Pertinent labs revealed initial troponin-I of 0.05 ng/ml. The remaining blood work, including complete blood count and the basic metabolic panel, was unremarkable.\n",
      "In the emergency department, the patient received immediate dual antiplatelet therapy, and cutaneous pacer pads were applied. Due to the focal exam findings, a computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) was performed rapidly with quick review ruling out dissection. CTA however revealed a small transverse, linear defect in the proximal aorta (Figure ). This defect was noted to propagate towards the root of the aortic valve on its anterior leaflet suggesting possible vegetation on the aortic valve. Given the ST changes and ongoing chest pain, the patient was taken immediately for cardiac catheterization which revealed a distal thrombus in the posterior left ventricular branch of the right coronary artery which was not amenable for intervention (Figures , ). During cardiac catheterization, right lower extremity pain and coolness suddenly worsened. Angiogram of the right lower extremity showed 100% occlusion of the right anterior and posterior tibial arteries (Figure ). The patient then went for emergent thrombo-embolectomy of the right tibio-peroneal trunk, with a marked resolution of symptoms. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed later confirming the vegetation in the aortic valve measuring about 6.5x4.0 mm (Figure ). Three sets of blood cultures were negative. Significant remarkable lab findings included C-reactive protein (CRP) of 10.5 ng/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 60 mm/hr, and positive rheumatoid arthritis screen. Extensive rheumatological and hypercoagulable workup including anti-nuclear antibodies, complement levels, anti-thrombin III activity, protein C & S levels, homocysteine levels, and other procoagulant markers were within the normal range.

CTA however revealed a small transverse, linear defect in the proximal aorta (Figure ). This defect was noted to propagate towards the root of the aortic valve on its anterior leaflet suggesting possible vegetation on the aortic valve. Given the ST changes and ongoing chest pain, the patient was taken immediately for cardiac catheterization which revealed a distal thrombus in the posterior left ventricular branch of the right coronary artery which was not amenable for intervention (Figures , ). During cardiac catheterization, right lower extremity pain and coolness suddenly worsened. Angiogram of the right lower extremity showed 100% occlusion of the right anterior and posterior tibial arteries (Figure ). The patient then went for emergent thrombo-embolectomy of the right tibio-peroneal trunk, with a marked resolution of symptoms. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed later confirming the vegetation in the aortic valve measuring about 6.5x4.0 mm (Figure ). Three sets of blood cultures were negative. Significant remarkable lab findings included C-reactive protein (CRP) of 10.5 ng/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 60 mm/hr, and positive rheumatoid arthritis screen. Extensive rheumatological and hypercoagulable workup including anti-nuclear antibodies, complement levels, anti-thrombin III activity, protein C & S levels, homocysteine levels, and other procoagulant markers were within the normal range. Specific testing for systemic scleroderma, Sjogren’s, and polymyositis were also unremarkable. Confirmatory testing with anti-cyclic citrullinated protein showed levels of >250 units establishing the diagnosis of RA. The patient was treated with systemic oral anticoagulation and was initiated on steroids.\n",

      "1. **Age < 50 years**: The patient is 28 years old, which is less than 50. Therefore, this criterion is met (true).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Heart rate < 100 beats per minute**: The patient's pulse is 112/min, which is greater than 100. Thus, this criterion is not met (false).\n",

      "3. **Oxygen saturation ≥ 95%**: The patient's oxygen saturation on room air is 90%, which is less than 95%. Therefore, this criterion is not met (false).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **No unilateral leg swelling**: The patient has bilateral pitting edema, but it is worse on the right side, indicating some degree of unilateral leg swelling. However, the criterion specifically mentions \"unilateral,\" and the presence of bilateral edema, even if worse on one side, suggests that the swelling is not exclusively unilateral. Given the information, we might interpret this as not meeting the criterion for unilateral swelling in the strictest sense, but since it's bilateral and worse on one side, it could be considered as not fully meeting the \"no unilateral leg swelling\" criterion due to the presence of swelling. However, for the purpose of PERC and clarity, bilateral swelling does not strictly fit the \"unilateral\" description, so we could consider this criterion as met (true) because the swelling is described as bilateral, even though it's asymmetric.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **No hemoptysis**: There is no mention of hemoptysis in the patient note. Assuming the criterion is met if not explicitly mentioned, this criterion is met (true).\n",

      "\n",
      "8. **No hormone (estrogen) use**: The patient is pregnant (gravida 3, para 2, at 34 weeks' gestation), which implies hormonal changes due to pregnancy, but there's no explicit mention of exogenous hormone (estrogen) use. Pregnancy itself involves significant hormonal changes, including increased estrogen levels, but the context of the PERC rule seems to focus on exogenous hormone use. Given the lack of explicit information about exogenous hormone use and considering pregnancy as a natural state rather than \"hormone use\" in the context of the rule, we might consider this criterion as met (true) for the purpose of this evaluation, although it's a point of potential debate.\n",

      "A 68-year-old man attended the Accident and Emergency department with increasing breathlessness but no chest pain, sputum production or haemoptysis. He had recently returned from holiday in Spain and his general practitioner prescribed amoxicillin for a presumed chest infection. He was a diet-controlled type 2 diabetic on treatment for hypertension. He had a 40-pack-year smoking history and had lost 4 kg in weight. Examination revealed an obese man with normal blood pressure, sinus tachycardia at 100 beats⋅min−1, with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths⋅min−1. His oxygen saturation was 96% on air. His white cell count was 11×109 cells⋅L−1 and C-reactive protein was 92 mg⋅L−1. Renal function and coagulation studies were normal.\n",
      "The admitting medical team felt that there was a “complete whiteout” of the left hemithorax and initially treated him for suspected severe community-­acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics and fluids, while arranging a respiratory opinion. Prophylactic low molecular weight ­heparin (LMWH) was also started. The respiratory team felt that an underlying malignancy may have been responsible for the radiographic appearances of left upper lobe collapse and suggested a ­computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax. shows a “veil-like” opacity projected over the left lung field, a raised left hemidiaphragm with blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with left upper lobe collapse, volume loss and an associated pleural effusion.\n",
      "The CT scan showed a large left hilar mass coalescing with the left upper lobe collapse. There were associated large para-aortic, subcarinal, mediastinal and supraclavicular nodes, a single liver metastasis and a second separate mass in the right lung. Lung cancer staging was T4N3M1b.\n",
      "It was interesting to note that a separate mass was present in the right lung (c). He did have metastatic disease but this might represent a synchronous primary, although by strict definition, to diagnose this, we needed to prove that the second mass was of different histology to the primary mass or that it was of the same histology but with no mediastinal or metastatic spread [].\n",
      "While awaiting a bronchoscopy, the patient coughed up ∼600 mL of fresh blood in 12 h, with worsening hypoxia. Repeat full blood count and coagulation studies were normal.\n",
      "The patient was having massive haemoptysis, defined as coughing up anything between 100 mL and 600 mL of fresh blood in 24 h [].\n",
      "He was seen by the on-call medical team and sat upright. Two large-bore cannulae were inserted in case of exsanguination. Sitting upright runs the risk of the blood spilling over into the normal lung. “Drowning” by filling up the bronchial tree with blood tends to occur before any true haemodynamic instability due to volume loss. As such, the mainstay of treatment in massive haem­optysis is to protect the normal lung and try to stop the bleeding [, ].\n",
      "The respiratory team felt that a palliative approach was too premature, but it was explained to him that his prognosis was poor with limited treatment options available. He agreed to a “do not resuscitate” plan. A treatment escalation plan was agreed to ensure his treatment was limited to level 2 care. Hypoxia precluded a bronchoscopy or transfer to the local cardiothoracic centre. Bronchoscopic strategies to control pulmonary haemorrhage include balloon tamponade, iced saline lavage, administration of a topical vasoconstrictor or coagulant, laser therapy and electrocautery [].\n",
      "The patient pointed to his left hemithorax when asked which side he felt the bleeding was coming from. Anecdotal experience suggests that patients with haemoptysis can often accurately indicate the side of the bleeding lesion. He was therefore positioned on his left side and tranexamic acid was administered intravenously. A pilot study evaluating the effect of tranexamic acid and the related antifibrinolytic agent aminocaproic acid included three patients with haemoptysis due to lung cancer []. All three patients experienced cessation of bleeding within 1–4 days without any recurrence. Patients received 1.5 g of intravenous tranexamic acid initially, followed by 1 g three times per day for a week after cessation of bleeding. The use of tranexamic acid in bleeding has been recognised for a long time [] and tranexamic acid may reduce both the duration and volume of bleeding, with low risk of short-term thromboembolic complications [].\n",
      "His haemoptysis and hypoxia improved over the ensuing days, and at bronchoscopy an organised clot was visualised in the left upper lobe bronchus with no endobronchial masses and a normal right bronchial tree. Left upper lobe lavage revealed no malignant cells on cytology. At endobronchial ultrasound examination, a large paratracheal node was sampled and histology demonstrated a poorly differentiated necrotic squamous cell carcinoma.\n",
      "The patient’s clinical condition slowly improved until 15 days into his admission, when overnight he developed acute dyspnoea with tachycardia at 120 beats⋅min−1. Arterial blood gas sampling measured his arterial oxygen tension (PaO) at 7.0 kPa on high flow oxygen via a reservoir bag, and an arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO) of 5.1 kPa. A repeat chest radiograph showed no change.\n",
      "The PA–aO is a measure of the difference between the alveolar concentration (A) of oxygen and the arterial (a) concentration of oxygen. In room air (inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.21) at sea level (atmospheric pressure of 760 mmHg) assuming 100% humidity in the alveoli, a simplified version of the equation is 21−((PaCO/0.8)−PaO), 0.8 being the respiratory quotient.\n",
      "High flow oxygen delivers ∼85% oxygen, so 85−(5.1/0.8)−7=71.625, which is significantly raised. While his PA–aO was likely to be raised due to his cancer/effusion, such a disparity and the clinical picture points towards the possibility of a pulmonary embolus. The use of the PA–aO is a useful adjunct in diagnosis []. There are numerous case reports about tranexamic acid increasing the risk of pulmonary emboli [, ]. In this case, the patient had other significant risk factors such as disseminated malignancy and a prolonged period of immobility.\n",
      "The patient understood that if left untreated, a large pulmonary embolus may prove fatal, but by treating it with anticoagulation, a major fatal haemoptysis was also more likely. He agreed to receive LMWH together with morphine for symptoms of dyspnoea and agitation. 6 h later, he had improved clinically and was able to safely lie flat briefly for a CT pulmonary angiogram. This confirmed large right-sided pulmonary emboli with associated right heart strain with reflux of contrast into the venous circulation (). The option of inferior vena cava filter insertion to prevent further embolic events was not available in our hospital, and he was too unstable to be transferred to an appropriate tertiary hospital. Over the following 2 days, urgent palliative radiotherapy to the left-sided tumour was arranged. After he had received a single fraction, further large volume haemoptysis recurred. LMWH was stopped and tranexamic acid restarted. The bleeding settled once more and he completed five fractions of radiotherapy. Slowly his oxygen saturations improved to 93% on air and he was discharged home on long-term full-dose LMWH with no recurrence of the haem­optysis.\n",
      "He presented 3 weeks later with progressive respiratory failure and his symptoms were palliated according to his wishes.\n",

The respiratory team felt that an underlying malignancy may have been responsible for the radiographic appearances of left upper lobe collapse and suggested a ­computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax. shows a “veil-like” opacity projected over the left lung field, a raised left hemidiaphragm with blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with left upper lobe collapse, volume loss and an associated pleural effusion.\n",
      "The CT scan showed a large left hilar mass coalescing with the left upper lobe collapse. There were associated large para-aortic, subcarinal, mediastinal and supraclavicular nodes, a single liver metastasis and a second separate mass in the right lung. Lung cancer staging was T4N3M1b.\n",
      "It was interesting to note that a separate mass was present in the right lung (c). He did have metastatic disease but this might represent a synchronous primary, although by strict definition, to diagnose this, we needed to prove that the second mass was of different histology to the primary mass or that it was of the same histology but with no mediastinal or metastatic spread [].\n",
      "While awaiting a bronchoscopy, the patient coughed up ∼600 mL of fresh blood in 12 h, with worsening hypoxia. Repeat full blood count and coagulation studies were normal.\n",
      "The patient was having massive haemoptysis, defined as coughing up anything between 100 mL and 600 mL of fresh blood in 24 h [].\n",
      "He was seen by the on-call medical team and sat upright. Two large-bore cannulae were inserted in case of exsanguination. Sitting upright runs the risk of the blood spilling over into the normal lung. “Drowning” by filling up the bronchial tree with blood tends to occur before any true haemodynamic instability due to volume loss. As such, the mainstay of treatment in massive haem­optysis is to protect the normal lung and try to stop the bleeding [, ].\n",
      "The respiratory team felt that a palliative approach was too premature, but it was explained to him that his prognosis was poor with limited treatment options available. He agreed to a “do not resuscitate” plan. A treatment escalation plan was agreed to ensure his treatment was limited to level 2 care. Hypoxia precluded a bronchoscopy or transfer to the local cardiothoracic centre. Bronchoscopic strategies to control pulmonary haemorrhage include balloon tamponade, iced saline lavage, administration of a topical vasoconstrictor or coagulant, laser therapy and electrocautery [].\n",
      "The patient pointed to his left hemithorax when asked which side he felt the bleeding was coming from. Anecdotal experience suggests that patients with haemoptysis can often accurately indicate the side of the bleeding lesion. He was therefore positioned on his left side and tranexamic acid was administered intravenously. A pilot study evaluating the effect of tranexamic acid and the related antifibrinolytic agent aminocaproic acid included three patients with haemoptysis due to lung cancer []. All three patients experienced cessation of bleeding within 1–4 days without any recurrence. Patients received 1.5 g of intravenous tranexamic acid initially, followed by 1 g three times per day for a week after cessation of bleeding. The use of tranexamic acid in bleeding has been recognised for a long time [] and tranexamic acid may reduce both the duration and volume of bleeding, with low risk of short-term thromboembolic complications [].\n",
      "His haemoptysis and hypoxia improved over the ensuing days, and at bronchoscopy an organised clot was visualised in the left upper lobe bronchus with no endobronchial masses and a normal right bronchial tree. Left upper lobe lavage revealed no malignant cells on cytology. At endobronchial ultrasound examination, a large paratracheal node was sampled and histology demonstrated a poorly differentiated necrotic squamous cell carcinoma.\n",
      "The patient’s clinical condition slowly improved until 15 days into his admission, when overnight he developed acute dyspnoea with tachycardia at 120 beats⋅min−1. Arterial blood gas sampling measured his arterial oxygen tension (PaO) at 7.0 kPa on high flow oxygen via a reservoir bag, and an arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO) of 5.1 kPa. A repeat chest radiograph showed no change.\n",
      "The PA–aO is a measure of the difference between the alveolar concentration (A) of oxygen and the arterial (a) concentration of oxygen. In room air (inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.21) at sea level (atmospheric pressure of 760 mmHg) assuming 100% humidity in the alveoli, a simplified version of the equation is 21−((PaCO/0.8)−PaO), 0.8 being the respiratory quotient.\n",
      "High flow oxygen delivers ∼85% oxygen, so 85−(5.1/0.8)−7=71.625, which is significantly raised. While his PA–aO was likely to be raised due to his cancer/effusion, such a disparity and the clinical picture points towards the possibility of a pulmonary embolus. The use of the PA–aO is a useful adjunct in diagnosis []. There are numerous case reports about tranexamic acid increasing the risk of pulmonary emboli [, ]. In this case, the patient had other significant risk factors such as disseminated malignancy and a prolonged period of immobility.\n",
      "The patient understood that if left untreated, a large pulmonary embolus may prove fatal, but by treating it with anticoagulation, a major fatal haemoptysis was also more likely. He agreed to receive LMWH together with morphine for symptoms of dyspnoea and agitation. 6 h later, he had improved clinically and was able to safely lie flat briefly for a CT pulmonary angiogram. This confirmed large right-sided pulmonary emboli with associated right heart strain with reflux of contrast into the venous circulation (). The option of inferior vena cava filter insertion to prevent further embolic events was not available in our hospital, and he was too unstable to be transferred to an appropriate tertiary hospital. Over the following 2 days, urgent palliative radiotherapy to the left-sided tumour was arranged. After he had received a single fraction, further large volume haemoptysis recurred. LMWH was stopped and tranexamic acid restarted. The bleeding settled once more and he completed five fractions of radiotherapy. Slowly his oxygen saturations improved to 93% on air and he was discharged home on long-term full-dose LMWH with no recurrence of the haem­optysis.\n",
      "He presented 3 weeks later with progressive respiratory failure and his symptoms were palliated according to his wishes.\n",

      "She had history of triple positive (ER+, PR+, HER2+) breast cancer and left radical mastectomy 15 years ago after which systemic chemotherapy and hormone therapy (Letrozole/Tamoxifen) was implemented. Three years before current presentation, bilateral hystero-salpingo-ovoforectomy, was performed. About 2 months ago, routine clinical examination by her oncologists revealed left axillary lymphadenopathy (2 × 3 cm) with fixed, firm and nontender node and an additional fixed mass (1 × 3 cm) in the anterior left forearm. Both lesions were excisionally biopsied. Further Imaging showed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and multiple metastatic lesions in the liver & abdomen and chest. PET scan showed 2 metastatic lesions in brain.\n",
      "Pathologic examination of excised node revealed metastatic breast cancer (ER+/HER2+) and salvage chemotherapy with Paclitaxel 100 mg and Gemcitabin 1000 mg weekly plus Herceptin (Trastuzumab) 440 mg and Perjecta (Pertuzumab) 14 mg/kg tri weekly was initiated. One day after the first dose of Herceptin and Perjecta and the fourth dose of Gemcitabin and Paclitaxel, the right lower extremity swelling developed and subsequent Compression ultrasound and Doppler studies revealed acute extensive thrombus formation in the superficial femoral vein of the right leg. The patient was admitted and anticoagulation therapy with LMVH (60 mg BID) was initiated under the supervision of an oncologist at a private hospital. Preliminary laboratory tests revealed mild pancytopenia with a platelet count of 60 000 that was attributed to recent chemotherapy.\n",
      "Two days after anticoagulation initiation she was discharged home.\n",
      "Shortly after discharge, she presented to our emergency department with complaint of severe shortness of breath beginning abruptly 2 hours ago.\n",
      "Her vital signs upon arrival to the emergency department showed a systolic blood pressure of 70 mm Hg, a heart rate of 155 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 40 per minute & oxygen saturation of 70% in ambient air. She was apparently pale, agitated, diaphoretic and unable to speak in full sentence. Jugular veins were distended and cardiac exam showed moderate tachycardia and a right ventricular heave.\n",
      "Pulmonary examination was unremarkable except for decreased breath sounds at the mid-zone of the left lung and the base of right lung.\n",
      "Radial pulses were very weak bilaterally with no palpable pulse in lower extremities. The initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 135 per minute, right bundle branch block with a QRS duration of 130 ms and right axis deviation of 110 degrees (Figure ).\n",
      "Bedside echocardiography performed despite severe agitation of the patient demonstrated preserved EF (EF = 50%-55%), severe right ventricular (RV) dilation and estimated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 45-50 mm Hg.\n",
      "Repeat laboratory findings showed Hemoglobin: 8 (g/dL), Platelets count: 50/mm3.\n",

      "Pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) confirmed large bilateral pulmonary thromboemboli with radiological evidence of RV strain (Figure ).\n",
      "According to hemodynamic compromise resulting from the massive pulmonary embolism and absolute contraindication for thrombolytic therapy due to brain metastases and concurrent thrombocytopenia, she became candidate for emergent catheter or surgical embolectomy. Surgical consult with cardiothoracic surgeon was requested but due to critical condition of the patient complicated by refractory hypoxia and unstable hemodynamic parameters surgery and anesthesiology team declared the patient as inoperable and there was no equipment and specialist for catheter embolectomy in our center.\n",

      "A 59-year-old female presented to the ED with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. Her abdominal pain began three hours before presentation and had awoken her from sleep. This abdominal pain was described as “achy,” 5/10, intermittent, and located in the left lower quadrant without radiation. She denied nausea or vomiting and had no diarrhea or blood in her stools. Review of systems revealed that the patient had symptoms of dysuria for one day and left-sided flank pain along with her abdominal pain. She denied fevers or chills. She stated that, despite taking her prescribed insulin injections, her blood sugars have been persistently elevated above 400 with her personal glucometer. Her past medical history was significant for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and prior cerebrovascular accident. She denied ever having any surgeries. She used regular insulin, Lantus (insulin glargine), and Ibuprofen. Her family history was noncontributory, and she denied alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use.\n",
      "Physical exam revealed a temperature of 36.5° C, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 166/81 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 99% on room air, and capillary blood glucose of 447 mg/dL. She was awake, alert, and interacting appropriately. Her pupils were equally round and reactive to light. The cardiac exam was normal and lungs were clear with breath sounds bilaterally. The abdomen was soft with minimal tenderness to palpation in the left periumbilical and left lower quadrant. There was no guarding or rebound. Extremities were warm and well-perfused. The neurological exam revealed no deficit.\n",
      "The metabolic panel revealed sodium of 132 mEq/L (normal 135–145), BUN of 45 mg/dL (normal 8–22), Creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL (normal 0.5–1.3), glucose of 473 mg/dL, and an anion gap of 8.0. A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/MM3 (normal 4.5–11.0) and a manual differential with 10.10 K/MM3 Neutrophils (normal 0.80–7.70). The hepatic panel was remarkable for an alkaline phosphatase of 189 U/L (normal 35–115). The urine was visibly clear and non-turbid. Urinalysis was leukocyte esterase and nitrate negative, but revealed large occult blood, glucosuria, protein of 300 mg/DL, and 3–6 WBC/HPF (normal 0–3).\n",
      "While laboratory studies were pending, the patient received one liter IV normal saline, four mg of morphine sulfate IV for pain, and 10 units of regular insulin. Despite fluid administration and analgesia, the patient continued to have worsening 6/10 abdominal pain. Given the patient’s presentation of undifferentiated abdominal pain without clear etiology and her immunocompromised state, a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was ordered. The CT scan revealed significant air in the bladder wall and lumen consistent with EC, severe left hydroureter and hydronephrosis without evidence of stones, and significant left perinephric stranding without gas in the renal parenchyma ().\n",

Her heart rate was persistently tachycardic (in the 130s), and she developed a fever to 39.4°C. In light of developing urosepsis and the potential for rapid progression to Emphysematous pyelonephritis, Interventional Radiology (IR) was consulted and placed a left nephrostomy tube to relieve the functional obstruction of the urinary tract just eight hours after the patient presented to the ED. After nephrostomy tube placement by IR, the patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. The urine culture grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae and the patient was continued on IV antibiotics.

She had no family history of cardiac disorders, including cardiac tumors. The patient's physical examination revealed blood pressure of 94/60 mmHg, heart rate of 120 beats/min, respiratory rate of 40/min, elevated jugular venous pressure with prominent ‘v’ wave. On cardiovascular system examination, S1 was normal, S2 was narrowly split with loud P2; a pan-systolic murmur of grade III/VI intensity was present along left sternal border. Tumor plop was audible. Chest was clear on auscultation. Abdominal examination was normal. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, right axis deviation and QR in V1 lead. Pulse oximetry revealed a saturation of 85% at room air increasing to 90% with 100% oxygen at 6 L/min. Laboratory examination revealed hemoglobin - 12.6 g/dl, total leukocytes count - 12.600/µL and platelet count of 1,00,000/µL. Liver function tests and renal function tests were normal.

      "Mrs. A.O., a 40-year-old known SCD patient with hemoglobin SS genotype was referred to the pulmonary division on account of dry cough of 3 weeks, difficulty in breathing of 2 weeks, and bilateral leg swelling of 4 days. There was low-grade fever, no weight loss, and no contact with chronic cough index. Difficulty in breathing initially occurred on exertion but later occurred even at rest. There was orthopnea but no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. There was bilateral leg swelling, which worsened progressively. No swelling in other parts of the body. No reduction in her urine volume. She was not a diagnosed asthmatic, hypertensive, or diabetic and she was not previously treated for tuberculosis or any other chronic lung diseases. She was only admitted for childbirth in her adulthood years. She had a single episode of blood transfusion when she was 6 years old. Afterwards, she has been crisis free for more than 20 years. She neither smokes cigarettes nor consumes alcoholic drinks. No history of exposure to cigarette smoke from others. She is married in a monogamous family with two girls and one boy. Her last childbirth was 15 years prior to presentation. She works as a secretary in the registration office of a state polytechnic. No history of exposure to occupational dust or fumes. No history of chronic drug use and no history of allergy.\n",

Oxygen saturation in room air was 78% and this increased to 92% on 5 L/min of oxygen via nasal prong.\n",
      "Respiratory examination revealed that she was in respiratory distress as evidenced by respiratory rate of 42/ min, flaring of alae nasi, and use of accessory muscles of respiration, and the trachea was central with symmetrical chest movement. Percussion note was resonant with coarse crepitations over the entire right lung and posterior lower zone of the left lung.\n",
      "Cardiovascular examination: pulse=100 beats/min, regular with premature beats, full volume; arterial wall was not thickened. No locomotor brachialis. BP was 105/60 mmHg.

Chest X-ray showed widespread reticulonodular opacities involving the whole of the right lung field and left upper zone with an area of hyperluscency in the left mid and lower zones.

On presentation, he was saturating 80% on room air, which improved to 96% with 6 l of the nasal cannula. His other vitals at presentation included: heart rate of 87 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, the temperature of 39.1C, and blood pressure of 135/60 mmHg. His height was 188 cm, weight 87.7 kg, and body mass index was 25. His C-reactive protein (CRP) was 19.8 mg/dL (normal: 0.3–1.0 mg/dL). Other admission laboratories included a point of care troponin (normal, 0.0 ng/ml), creatinine of 1.17 mg/dL, carbon dioxide of 27 mmol/L, procalcitonin of 0.31 ng/ml, lactic acid of 1.5 mmol/L, normal liver transaminases, normal prothrombin time, white blood cell count (8.9 10^9/L) and differential, hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL. No D-Dimer or brain natriuretic peptide testing was performed and per the initial assessment, since there were no complaints of leg swelling, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was not performed, however, a chest X-ray demonstrated “multi-focal consolidation most consistent with typical viral bronchopneumonia” []. No other source of bacterial infection or cause of acute respiratory failure was identified, and a COVID polymerase chain reaction test was positive. He required mechanical ventilation (initial setting: rate: 24/min; positive end-expiratory pressure: 14 mmHg; peak inspiratory pressure: 31 mmHg; tidal volume: 460 ml; FIO2: 0.70) the following day with a CRP of 23.6 mg/dL and a ferritin of 1039 ng/mL (normal: 38–380 ng/mL).

      "3. **Oxygen saturation ≥ 95%**: Initially, the patient's oxygen saturation was 80% on room air, but it improved to 96% with 6 liters of nasal cannula. Since the criterion specifies \"oxygen saturation,\" we consider the context of oxygen therapy. However, given that the patient's saturation improved to above 95% with supplemental oxygen, and considering the spirit of the rule which aims to identify low-risk patients, we might interpret this as meeting the criterion in the context of PERC, which focuses on the absence of hypoxia as a significant risk factor. But strictly speaking, the initial saturation was below 95% on room air. For the purpose of this evaluation and considering the patient's condition improved with oxygen, we will consider this criterion as met (true) under the assumption that the patient's condition was managed appropriately with supplemental oxygen.\n",

Therefore, at the time of initial presentation, this criterion is met (true).\n",

On admission, his vital signs were blood pressure 138/93, heart rate 65 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed regular rate and rhythm, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops and clear lungs on auscultation. Neurologic examination revealed intact cranial nerves, preserved strength in all extremities with an exception of mild dysmetria in the left upper extremity and an NIH score of 1. Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, non-specific ST changes, and a premature ventricular contraction. Transthoracic echocardiogram was notable for normal left ventricular function with mild tricuspid regurgitation and stage 1 diastolic dysfunction. Transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for intracardiac thrombus. The echocardiography with agitated saline contrast revealed microbubbles of moderate opacity entering the left atrium from the left lower pulmonary vein indicative of a grade 2 intra-pulmonary arteriovenous shunt ().

      "A 38-year-old G2P2 African American woman presented with 3-hour duration of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Her pain was acute in onset and constant in nature, radiated to both groins, and was progressively worsening. She denied any musculoskeletal pain. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension, fibroid uterus, and a cholecystectomy. She had worsening menorrhagia over the past two months. Her last gynecologic evaluation was three years prior to presentation. She reported tobacco use and denied alcohol or drug consumption. Physical examination revealed diffuse rebound tenderness and a palpable abdominal mass. Initial vital signs were as follows: temperature of 38.6°C, heart rate of 122 beats per minute, blood pressure of 48/37, and respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 88% and increased to 94% on 2 liters of nasal oxygen.\n",
      "Biochemical testing showed an elevated white blood cell count (13.5 K/μL), significant neutrophilia (94.8%), an elevatedcreatinine (3.8 mg/dL), low hemoglobin (8.9 g/dL), low potassium (3.2 mEq/L), and an elevated myoglobin (2140 ng/mL, normal range: 0–101 ng/mL). A cardiac and skeletal muscle enzyme panel was normal. Baseline creatinine from a prior admission was normal (0.6 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed trace blood and amorphous sediment. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed a 24 cm × 13 cm × 13 cm complex mass occupying the pelvis and extending to the upper abdomen (). Both kidneys appeared normal in size without perinephric inflammation, hydronephrosis, or hydroureter. Renal sonography revealed normal echotexture and ureteral caliber.\n",
      "The working diagnosis was acute septic shock with associated acute renal failure. The patient had nonanion gap metabolic acidosis with a lactic acid level of 4.5 mmol/L (normal 0.4–2 mmol/L) and a pH of 7.40 with a compensatory decrease in PCO secondary to hyperventilation. Blood and urine cultures were obtained and the patient was started on intravenous fluid resuscitation, a bicarbonate drip, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. A norepinephrine infusion was used to maintain a normotensive state. The pelvic mass was thought to be the source of the patient's abdominal pain and represented a degenerating fibroid that was contributing to her critical presentation with worsening inflammation and myoglobinemia. Relevant tumor markers including CEA, AFP, CA-125, and inhibins A and B were normal.\n",
      "The patient's overall status continued to worsen the following day. She became obtunded with loss of consciousness, in sinus tachycardia, and hypotensive despite all aforementioned measures. Endotracheal intubation then followed. Furthermore, her renal function continued to deteriorate (creatinine of 7 mg/dL). Urine and blood cultures had still not yielded any bacterial growth. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated and the decision to perform an exploratory laparotomy and remove the pelvic mass followed, as it was attributed to the patient's worsening critical state.\n",
      "A large solitary fibroid was found within the left broad ligament that was densely adherent and contiguous with the uterus. The uterus and adnexal structures appeared significantly devitalized and edematous and were displacing the ureters without evidence of hydroureter. The bowels appeared normal. A total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed with an estimated blood loss of 150 mL. The patient remained intubated and returned to the surgical intensive care unit. The postoperative period was complicated by atrial fibrillation that responded to intravenous amiodarone in addition to anemia (Hg 6.7 g/dL) requiring blood transfusion.\n",
      "Dramatic biochemical improvement occurred over the next 48 hours with CRRT following surgery. Final blood and urine cultures were negative at 48 hours. Serum creatinine decreased to 1.4 mg/dL but however rebounded slowly over the following three days and peaked at 3.1 mg/dL. Serum myoglobin reached a nadir of 380.4 ng/mL by the fourth postoperative day (POD) and steadily increased and reached a plateau of 1074 ng/mL by POD-8 (). Clinical improvement followed with defervescence and normalization of vital signs by POD-3 and POD-5, respectively. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were discontinued at this time. The patient had normal sinus rhythm, was normotensive without any vasopressors, and was extubated uneventfully. The pathology reported a 29.4 × 20.8 × 19.7 cm large solitary leiomyoma weighing 3028 grams and showing extensive loss of nuclei from cells, stromal hyalinization, polymorphonuclear white blood cell infiltrate, and foci of calcifications reflecting various stages of early and late fibroid degenerative changes (). Both adnexal structures showed an extensive infiltrate of polymorphonuclear cells suggestive of severe and acute inflammation.\n",
      "The patient was discharged on POD-8 in a stable condition. Serum creatinine remained stable at 2.9 mg/dL, and myoglobin was 1074 ng/mL. She showed complete biochemical and clinical remission by her 4-week follow-up with a return to baseline serum creatinine (0.6 mg/dL) and a normal serum myoglobin of 25 ng/mL ().

      "A 48-year-old diabetic male was referred to us with a diagnosis of basal VSR, approximately 2 weeks before MI. He had a history of breathlessness of New York Heart Association class III with bilateral pedal edema and oliguria for the past 15 days. On admission, he was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and heart rate of 110/min. He had elevated cardiac markers (troponin I of 0.1 ng/mL) with electrocardiogram showing Q waves in leads II, III avf showing evolved inferior wall (IW) and right ventricle (RV) MI. A two-dimensional echocardiography showed hypokinetic basal septum and a huge VSR [] of 18 × 20 mm in size shunting left to right [] with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (RV systolic pressure of 75 mmHg) and biventricular dysfunction and mild mitral regurgitation (MR) with an RV wall motion index (WMI) of 0.8. An elective coronary angiogram showed proximal tight occlusions of both the right coronary artery (RCA) and the obtuse marginal (OM) branch of the left circumflex. The left anterior descending artery was normal. He was planned for surgical closure of the VSR with grafts to OM and RCA territories after a week's time.\n",
      "A Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted after induction showing a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 24 mmHg, a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and diastolic pressure (DP) of 60 and 33 mmHg, respectively, and a diastolic pulmonary gradient of 9 mmHg. The central venous pressure (CVP) was 15 mmHg. Simultaneous right atrial and pulmonary artery saturations showed a step up of 30%. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was instituted with aorto bicaval cannulation and the heart was arrested by Del Nido cardioplegia (aortic root). After adequate retraction, a vertical left ventriculotomy was done parallel to the posterior descending artery (PDA) in the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. The VSR was visualized with difficulty by retracting the papillary muscle [] and its chordae tendinae. It was closed with bovine pericardium with interrupted 2-0 polypropylene sutures using David technique. The left ventriculotomy was closed [] followed by OM and PDA grafting as planned. After adequate period of CPB support with an aortic cross clamp time of 88 min and CPB time of 145 min, the patient was weaned off CPB. Transesophageal echo showed intact VSR patch with biventricular dysfunction. During closure, arterial pressures were 100/60 mmHg with a PASP of 45 and DP of 23 mmHg. The patient was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with supports of inj. dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min, inj. adrenaline 0.08 μg/kg/min, and inj. vasopressin 2 IU/h. As the cardiac contractility was reasonably alright, IABP was not inserted in the operation theater with a low threshold of insertion in case of eventuality.\n",

After 6 h, there was a drop in CO and SVR elevation, and hence a 40-cc IABP was inserted percutaneously through the right common femoral artery (CFA). The patient's hemodynamics improved and he was extubated on the second postoperative day (POD). As he was hemodynamically stable, on the fourth POD, IABP was removed with inj. dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min and inj. adrenaline 0.05 μg/kg/min. Six hours later, there was once again a drop in the CI and CO and echo showed severe RV dysfunction with a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) value of 8 mm. Inotropes were hiked with no further improvement. Twelve hours later, the patient became dyspneic, tachypneic with a mixed venous oxygen saturation (MVO2) of 35%, and a pulmonary vascular resistance of 250 dynes-s/cm5 and was electively re-intubated in view of hypoxia due to low cardiac output. A sheathless 34-cc IABP was re-inserted percutaneously through the left CFA. The hemodynamics improved and MVO2 improved to 70%. He was extubated the next day and a decision was made to retain the IABP.

      "1. **Age < 50 years**: The patient is 69 years old, which is greater than 50. Therefore, this criterion is not met (false).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Heart rate < 100 beats per minute**: The patient's heart rate is mentioned as 60 beats/min when recumbent but increases to 120 beats/min when upright. Since the heart rate exceeds 100 beats per minute in the upright position, this criterion is not met (false) for the condition described, but we should consider the context of the question which seems to focus on the resting or initial condition. However, given the information, we must acknowledge the heart rate does exceed 100 at some point, but based on the initial presentation, it might be considered as not always exceeding 100. For the purpose of this evaluation and considering the context of PERC criteria application, we might lean towards considering this as not always meeting the risk factor threshold due to the specific scenario described, but strictly speaking, the patient does experience a heart rate over 100. Thus, it could be argued either way, but given the emphasis on the initial presentation, we could consider this as true in a very lenient interpretation, but more accurately, it should be false due to the patient's condition.\n",

      "3. **Oxygen saturation ≥ 95%**: The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% when recumbent and desaturates to 80% when upright on 100% supplemental oxygen. Therefore, this criterion is not met (false) because the saturation is below 95% in both scenarios described.\n",

      "A 57-year-old white man presented with a 3-month history of new-onset, severe, bi-frontal headaches and a 13.6 kg (30-lb) weight loss. Local emergency room evaluation revealed a negative computed tomography (CT) scan of his head. Laboratory findings included an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 80 mm/hour and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 55.3 mg/L. He was discharged with pain control.\n",
      "During follow-up with his local primary provider, his headache persisted and bilateral jaw pain and left facial numbness had developed. He was started on prednisone 60 mg/day for presumed GCA with partial improvement in his headache. Bilateral temporal artery biopsies were performed 3 days later and were negative. Prednisone was subsequently discontinued. Two weeks later his headache progressed and right eye horizontal diplopia and perioral numbness developed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain was performed and interpreted as normal. He was admitted for pulse-dose steroids (1000 mg daily for 3 days) which led to resolution of visual symptoms and was discharged on prednisone 60 mg/day. Tapering below 50 mg/day was unsuccessful due to rising inflammatory markers, symptom progression, and return of diplopia. Severe left hip pain developed for which plain radiographs were obtained but negative for fracture or avascular necrosis.\n",
      "On referral to our institution he continued to have ongoing headache and left jaw numbness despite 6 weeks of high-dose glucocorticoids (80 mg/day). Left hip pain had worsened to the point of wheelchair dependency. His past medical history was remarkable for atrial fibrillation for which he was receiving warfarin 2 mg/day and diltiazem 240 mg/day. Social history was notable for lack of tobacco or alcohol use and absence of known environmental exposures during his employment as an office manager. Aside from prostate cancer in his father, our patient’s family history was negative for other pertinent diagnoses of additional malignancies or autoimmune conditions. Laboratory evaluation noted an ESR 72 mm/hour, CRP 53 mg/L, hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL, leukocytes 5.2 × 109/L and platelets 110 × 109/L, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.3, creatinine 1.04 mg/dL, calcium 11.6 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase 106 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 64 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 360 U/L, total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL, total protein 5.1 g/dL, and albumin 3.4 g/dL. Previously obtained autoimmune serologies were negative for antinuclear and extractable nuclear antigens as well as rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, myeloperoxidase, and proteinase-3 antibodies.\n",
      "His vital signs demonstrated a heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 94/44 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 12 per minute, oxygenation saturation of 96%, and weight of 144 kg with body mass index (BMI) of 48.6 kg/m2. An examination was notable for a Cushingoid appearance and morbid obesity. Evaluation of adenopathy and splenomegaly was limited due to body habitus. Pertinent cardiovascular findings included irregularly irregular pulse without murmurs. Upper and lower arterial pulses were normal and symmetric. Common superficial temporal artery palpation was without tenderness or nodularity. Trace pitting edema was noted to the ankle bilaterally. Breath sounds were equal and symmetric without wheezing or rhonchi. Aside from scattered bruising at site of venipuncture, no cutaneous abnormalities were noted. A neurologic examination showed normal speech without language deficits. Visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally. Cranial nerves 2–12 were assessed and normal except for mild esotropia of his right eye and hypoesthesia to light touch and pinprick over the left mandibular region of the left trigeminal nerve. The remaining dermatomes evaluated showed normal sensation. Reflexes were normal and symmetric throughout and toes were down-going bilaterally. No ataxia was observed. A musculoskeletal examination demonstrated normal range of motion of upper extremities without deficit. Marked pain was noted on passive and active range of motion of his left hip.\n",
      "Given the persistent headache despite high-dose glucocorticoids and atypical features, alternative etiologies were suspected. The local MRI of his brain was reviewed and evidence of abnormal enhancing soft tissue involving Meckel’s cave bilaterally with extension through the foramen ovale was noted (Fig. a). The differential diagnosis for infiltrative process in Meckel’s cave included sarcoidosis as well as primary or secondary neoplastic lesions such as meningioma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, schwannoma, neurofibroma, and lymphoma [, ]. The presence of constitutional symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers suggested a secondary process with associated intracranial involvement. As such, positron emission tomography (PET)-CT was obtained. This demonstrated extensive hypermetabolic lesions throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton, including the skull base, as well as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm (Fig. c). MRI of his left hip revealed diffusely abnormal marrow signal suggestive of infiltrative disease. A cervical lymph node biopsy demonstrated evidence of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and staging bone marrow biopsy revealed a hypercellular marrow (90%) with diffuse large B cell lymphoma involving 70% of the total cellularity (Fig. ). Initiation of high-dose methotrexate (3.5 g/m2), rituximab (375 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m2), hydroxydaunorubicin (50 mg/m2), Oncovin (vincristine; 2 mg), and prednisone (255 mg) (MR-CHOP; 21-day cycle) resulted in interval improvement in his headache and visual symptoms (Fig. b, d).\n",
      "Ten months after initial diagnosis and 4 months after completion of his sixth cycle of MR-CHOP, our patient re-presented with bilateral lower extremity weakness and PET-CT showed recurrence of disease with evidence of neurolymphomatosis of multiple cervical, thoracic, and sacral nerve roots. Intrathecal cytarabine (50 mg) was given and ibrutinib (140 mg/day) was initiated, resulting in initial findings of improved strength and subsequent decreased nerve root FDG-avidity.\n",

He was admitted for pulse-dose steroids (1000 mg daily for 3 days) which led to resolution of visual symptoms and was discharged on prednisone 60 mg/day. Tapering below 50 mg/day was unsuccessful due to rising inflammatory markers, symptom progression, and return of diplopia. Severe left hip pain developed for which plain radiographs were obtained but negative for fracture or avascular necrosis.\n",
      "On referral to our institution he continued to have ongoing headache and left jaw numbness despite 6 weeks of high-dose glucocorticoids (80 mg/day). Left hip pain had worsened to the point of wheelchair dependency. His past medical history was remarkable for atrial fibrillation for which he was receiving warfarin 2 mg/day and diltiazem 240 mg/day. Social history was notable for lack of tobacco or alcohol use and absence of known environmental exposures during his employment as an office manager. Aside from prostate cancer in his father, our patient’s family history was negative for other pertinent diagnoses of additional malignancies or autoimmune conditions. Laboratory evaluation noted an ESR 72 mm/hour, CRP 53 mg/L, hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL, leukocytes 5.2 × 109/L and platelets 110 × 109/L, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.3, creatinine 1.04 mg/dL, calcium 11.6 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase 106 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 64 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 360 U/L, total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL, total protein 5.1 g/dL, and albumin 3.4 g/dL. Previously obtained autoimmune serologies were negative for antinuclear and extractable nuclear antigens as well as rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, myeloperoxidase, and proteinase-3 antibodies.\n",
      "His vital signs demonstrated a heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 94/44 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 12 per minute, oxygenation saturation of 96%, and weight of 144 kg with body mass index (BMI) of 48.6 kg/m2. An examination was notable for a Cushingoid appearance and morbid obesity. Evaluation of adenopathy and splenomegaly was limited due to body habitus. Pertinent cardiovascular findings included irregularly irregular pulse without murmurs. Upper and lower arterial pulses were normal and symmetric. Common superficial temporal artery palpation was without tenderness or nodularity. Trace pitting edema was noted to the ankle bilaterally. Breath sounds were equal and symmetric without wheezing or rhonchi. Aside from scattered bruising at site of venipuncture, no cutaneous abnormalities were noted. A neurologic examination showed normal speech without language deficits. Visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally. Cranial nerves 2–12 were assessed and normal except for mild esotropia of his right eye and hypoesthesia to light touch and pinprick over the left mandibular region of the left trigeminal nerve. The remaining dermatomes evaluated showed normal sensation. Reflexes were normal and symmetric throughout and toes were down-going bilaterally. No ataxia was observed. A musculoskeletal examination demonstrated normal range of motion of upper extremities without deficit. Marked pain was noted on passive and active range of motion of his left hip.\n",
      "Given the persistent headache despite high-dose glucocorticoids and atypical features, alternative etiologies were suspected. The local MRI of his brain was reviewed and evidence of abnormal enhancing soft tissue involving Meckel’s cave bilaterally with extension through the foramen ovale was noted (Fig. a). The differential diagnosis for infiltrative process in Meckel’s cave included sarcoidosis as well as primary or secondary neoplastic lesions such as meningioma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, schwannoma, neurofibroma, and lymphoma [, ]. The presence of constitutional symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers suggested a secondary process with associated intracranial involvement. As such, positron emission tomography (PET)-CT was obtained. This demonstrated extensive hypermetabolic lesions throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton, including the skull base, as well as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm (Fig. c). MRI of his left hip revealed diffusely abnormal marrow signal suggestive of infiltrative disease. A cervical lymph node biopsy demonstrated evidence of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and staging bone marrow biopsy revealed a hypercellular marrow (90%) with diffuse large B cell lymphoma involving 70% of the total cellularity (Fig. ). Initiation of high-dose methotrexate (3.5 g/m2), rituximab (375 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m2), hydroxydaunorubicin (50 mg/m2), Oncovin (vincristine; 2 mg), and prednisone (255 mg) (MR-CHOP; 21-day cycle) resulted in interval improvement in his headache and visual symptoms (Fig. b, d).\n",
      "Ten months after initial diagnosis and 4 months after completion of his sixth cycle of MR-CHOP, our patient re-presented with bilateral lower extremity weakness and PET-CT showed recurrence of disease with evidence of neurolymphomatosis of multiple cervical, thoracic, and sacral nerve roots. Intrathecal cytarabine (50 mg) was given and ibrutinib (140 mg/day) was initiated, resulting in initial findings of improved strength and subsequent decreased nerve root FDG-avidity.\n",

Yet, for the purpose of this evaluation and without explicit mention of \"recent trauma or surgery\" as a concern, we might lean towards assuming this criterion could be considered met due to lack of explicit information linking these procedures directly to the current condition being evaluated. However, this is a nuanced interpretation. Given the information provided and the focus on \"recent trauma or surgery\" as it pertains to the risk of pulmonary embolism, and considering the patient has had medical interventions, it's reasonable to consider this criterion as not met (false) due to the presence of recent medical procedures that could potentially increase the risk of thromboembolic events.\n",

      "The subject of this report is a 29 year old male, US citizen of Palestinian descent, who works full-time as a biomedical research technician. His health history is unremarkable, except for the fact that at age 16 he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Since then, he has been treated successfully with mesalamine (1.2 g, 2 times per day), azathioprine (50 mg, 3 times per day), and ursidiol (300 mg, 2 times per day). The subject has been able to live an active lifestyle and participate in a variety of sports including running, weightlifting, basketball, and baseball. The subject denies any history of smoking or use of alcohol, opioids, or illicit drugs. On April 22, 2020, the subject's father, who lives in the same house as the subject, and works for a major shipping company, was diagnosed with COVID-19. This was about 2 months after the first case of COVID had been confirmed in his state of residence, which was one of the early active zones of COVID-19 transmission in the US. On April 25, the patient began to experience general malaise and fatigue. Over the next 24 h, the symptoms worsened to include severe fatigue and weakness, loss of appetite, tiredness, slight dry cough, body aches, muscle pain, loss of taste and smell, sore throat and fever. The patient was then seen by his general practice physician. Vital signs at the time of examination were BP 110/72, pulse 97 BPM, respiration 14 per minute, oxygen saturation 98%, and body temperature 101.7°F. The patient was given a naso-pharyngeal swab, real-time RT-PCR test [COBAS (R) SARS-COV-@ test, Labcorp Laboratories, South Bend, IN] that confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19. In compliance with standard medical practice standards, the patient was ordered to self-isolate and to start a 5-day course of azithromycin (250 mg, daily), and to also take 1 g of paracetamol (acetaminophen) every 6 h for treatment of pain and fever. Despite good adherence to the recommended treatment, the symptoms other than fever, did not improve, and he also started to feel depressed, demotivated, and spend long periods in bed. During this period, the patient experienced ongoing generalized myalgia and musculoskeletal pain. He described the pain as persistent and relatively severe (rated 7 on a scale of 1–10). Because of this discomfort, after 4 days the patient decided to consume kratom to relieve his symptoms. According to the patient, he had first used kratom 14 months earlier before his COVID-19 infection. He used kratom sporadically (no more than 4–5 times in total) as a cognitive enhancer and not to self-treat pain.\n",
      "The patient decided to take 2.5 gms (or grams) of green kratom (as ground leaf powder suspended in water). The product was purchased at a local shop in April 2020 sold under the name “Green Bali.” After 30 min, he noticed a significant improvement in the intensity of the physical symptoms (mainly pain and fatigue), and within 60 min he felt a sensation of mild euphoria and well-being that lasted for about 5 h. After 6 h following consumption the effects of kratom wore off, and the patient administered another dose. He used kratom three times a day continuously for 3 days (for a total of 9 doses of 2.75 g each) with significant benefit.\n",
      "When asked to score from 0 to 100% the improvement that kratom had on COVID-19 symptoms: fatigue and weakness (80% improvement), tiredness (70% improvement), body aches (80% improvement), muscle pain (90% improvement, “much better than paracetamol/acetaminophen”). The kratom did not seem to have an impact on: fever, cough, or sore throat. The patient also stated: “I didn't have anxiety or any psychological symptoms. For me, kratom mainly gave improvement in physical reaction.” “It also elevated my mood and made me feel less miserable, to the point where I was able to get out of bed, shower, look at work emails without feeling completely exhausted and drained”; “Kratom helped me more than antibiotic”; “I slept better, I essentially fell asleep immediately. Without kratom, sleep was not nice, with kratom less wake ups, about 6 h.” Over the next 2 weeks the patient's symptoms gradually subsided and on May 13 he had a televisit with his physician and a follow-up swab test that was negative for COVID-19. The subject was able to end his quarantine and return to work in early June. In a follow-up interview with us, the patient reported that he did not experience any side effects from using kratom, except for a very bad taste when swallowing it. The patient was also able to discontinue kratom use immediately without any evidence of physical or psychological withdrawal symptoms. The patient also informed us that he still had some of the kratom product that he had taken and he agreed to provide us with a sample for chemical analysis.\n",
      "An established quantitative liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method was conducted () and found that the sample obtained from the patient is kratom due to the presence of mitragynine (102 mg/g kratom powder) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (0.8 mg/g kratom powder). The extracted kratom sample was analyzed for the presence of 13 opioids and 8 benzodiazepines by comparing the chromatograms to those of the reference mixtures Pain Management Multi-component Opiate Mixture-13 solution and Benzodiazepine Multi-component Mixture-8 solution. These data suggest the sample was not fortified with 7-hydroxymitragynine and there was also no evidence of adulteration with opioids or common benzodiazepines in the sample.\n",

      "A 73-year-old female was brought by emergency medical services (EMS) to the emergency department (ED) after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). She was driving when her car crashed into a streetlamp at 40 miles per hour. The EMS team reported that the pole intruded into the passenger compartment and the patient required a prolonged extrication. She had a Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) of 11 when EMS arrived at the scene, which improved to a 15 after repeated evaluations. She was conscious, alert, and oriented at the scene and during transport.\n",
      "The patient had difficulty recalling the events before the collision. She remembered feeling “like I was having a panic attack” just before the crash, and she did not recall the car impacting the streetlamp. In the ED, she complained of substernal chest pressure. The patient’s history was limited due to her continued difficulty recalling the events of the accident. The patient’s son was contacted and he stated that she lives alone and is active and independent. He stated that she had experienced syncopal episodes over the last several years, all associated with paroxysms of panic when driving, and she had undergone extensive workups without any clear etiology identified. She had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain with and without contrast four years prior for stroke-like symptoms after a syncopal event. Per his report, no abnormalities were found.\n",
      "The patient had a past medical history of anxiety, migraines, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and hyperlipidemia. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, which was treated with a left mastectomy followed by five years of tamoxifen and letrozole treatment. She had a family history of dementia, diabetes, and heart disease. She denied using tobacco, alcohol, or illicit substances. She was prescribed, and was taking, the following medications: levothyroxine 25 micrograms daily; atorvastatin 20 milligrams (mg) nightly; rizatriptan 10 mg as needed for headaches; and multivitamins.\n",
      "On physical exam, the patient’s temperature was 36.5° Celsius, her heart rate was 92 beats per minute, and her blood pressure was 142/72 millimeters of mercury. She was breathing at a rate of 21 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She weighed 125 pounds and was 5 feet, 3 inches tall, with a body mass index of 22.1 kilograms per meter squared. She did not appear to be in any acute distress, was healthy appearing, and was oriented to her name, date, and location. Her head was normocephalic and atraumatic; she had no Battle sign, raccoon eyes, or other signs of trauma. She had hearing aids in place bilaterally. She had normal extraocular movements with equal pupils that were reactive to light. She had a cervical collar in place. Later, when it was safe to remove her collar, her neck had a normal range of motion without rigidity or pain.\n",
      "On auscultation, her heart had a regular S1 and S2 at a normal rate and was without murmurs. She had normal pulses bilaterally. Her lungs were clear without wheezing or rhonchi, and she was noted to have normal effort without respiratory distress. Her abdomen was soft and flat, without tenderness or guarding. Her musculoskeletal exam showed an overall normal range of motion without deformities. She had no step-offs of the spinous processes or tenderness along the midline spine. The remainder of her skeletal exam only revealed tenderness over the left wrist. She had a capillary refill of less than two seconds. On her skin exam, she had minor contusions to the left upper chest near the axilla with superficial abrasions along the left wrist. She was not diaphoretic. Neurologically she had no cranial nerve deficits, with no motor weakness or sensory deficits peripherally. She had a normal gait and normal coordination as well.

      "A 71-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension presented to our community emergency department (ED) transported by emergency medical services (EMS) with the chief complaints of chest pain, difficulty breathing, back pain, and weakness of both lower extremities. He had an abrupt onset of chest pain, described as a sharp and stabbing pain, while using his rototiller in the garden, 6 h prior to arrival. His symptoms continued to progress to the point that he was having difficulty breathing and starting to have trouble walking for which EMS was called. Per EMS, they noted rapidly progressing symptoms while en route to the ED. Vitals on arrival to the ED are as follows: 94.5 °F, blood pressure of 91/64 mmHg, heart rate of 109 beats/min, respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min, and 100% pulse oximetry on room air. On physical exam, he was toxic appearing, in acute distress, and diaphoretic. Jugular venous distention was present. Cardiopulmonary exam was notable for tachycardia, distant heart sounds, and the presence of bibasilar rales. His skin/lower extremities were pale, mottled, and he was unable to move them. Carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally, radial pules 1+ bilaterally, femoral pulses 1+ bilaterally, with absent popliteal pulses. On neurological exam, he had dysarthric speech, left-sided facial droop, and loss of strength and sensation in his lower extremities.\n",
      "The patient was placed on non-invasive positive pressure. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia with premature atrial complexes, a right bundle branch block, with non-specific ST/T wave changes in the anterior leads. Portable chest radiography taken in an upright position (Fig. ) demonstrated a widened mediastinum at about 10.5 cm. A bedside point of care cardiac ultrasound revealed a significant pericardial effusion. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast was unremarkable for any acute process. Pertinent laboratory evaluation:\n",
      "Hemoglobin of 9.2 (13.5–17 g/dL) Arterial blood gas: pH 7.01, pCO2 45, p02 116, HCO3 12 Initial lactic acid of 8.3 (0.5–2.2 mmol/L) that increased to 14.8 Blood/urea/nitrogen of 42 (8–22 mg/dL) Creatinine of 3.06 (0.6–1.4 mg/dL).\n",
      "CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast revealed a Stanford type A dissection with an intimal tear beginning at the level of the aortic root and extending throughout the course of the thoracic aorta and into the abdominal aorta (Figs. , , and ). Additional findings on CT included involvement of the origins of the great vessels (brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery). Hemopericardium is visualized with high suspicion for pericardial tamponade. There is dilation of the ascending thoracic aorta measuring up to 5.2 cm. The dissection continues distally (Figs. and ) to involve the left common iliac artery and bilateral external iliac arteries.\n",
      "He was transferred emergently to a tertiary center and was taken immediately to the operating room for definitive repair. The patient underwent sternotomy, repair of Stanford type A dissection with right groin cannulation, and repair of the right femoral artery and vein. He arrived in the surgical intensive care unit in guarded condition, his sternotomy was left open secondary to severe coagulopathy intraoperatively, and he was on an epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin infusion. By day 2, continuous renal replacement therapy (CCRT) was initiated for acute tubular necrosis. Vascular surgery was consulted to evaluate a pulseless right lower extremity status post right femoral artery cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass. Given the patient had an open sternotomy with five chest tubes with significant output requiring transfusion of multiple blood products throughout the night, vascular surgery could not perform a femoral-femoral bypass or axillofemoral bypass without heparinization.\n",
      "By day 3, he underwent mediastinal irrigation and sternal closure with cardiothoracic surgery. He was then taken for a right common femoral endarterectomy, iliofemoral and lower extremity embolectomy, and right lower extremity four-compartment fasciotomy secondary to acute ischemia of the right lower extremity. In addition, neurosurgery evaluated the patient because he was not spontaneously moving his extremities after surgery and there was concern that the dissection had caused an infarction of his thoracic spinal cord, resulting in paraplegia. By day 4, he remained stuporous off sedation and on maximum pressor support (norepinephrine infusion at 30 mcg/min, epinephrine infusion at 10 mcg/min, and a vasopressin infusion at 0.04 units/min). He continued to have upper extremity non-epileptic myoclonic jerks secondary to continued renal failure. CT of the head revealed multiple 1 to 2 cm foci consistent with likely subacute infarcts related to embolic disease. By day 5, a family discussion was had regarding a poor neurological prognosis for independent neurological recovery with likely permanent cognitive and motor deficits. His code status was subsequently changed to do not resuscitate (DNR) with no further escalation of care. The patient continued to deteriorate throughout the night, became asystolic, and expired.\n",

      "A 38-year-old Caribbean-Black (Afro-Trinidadian) female with a medical history of endometriosis, intermittently adherent with the oral contraceptive pill, initially presented to the adult emergency department with acute dyspnea during the preceding 2 days. Her vital signs reflected systolic blood pressures of 142 mm Hg, heart rate of 112 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Her physical examination revealed a mildly elevated jugular venous pulse (10 cm of water), right chest stony dullness, no peripheral edema, and active menses.\n",
      "A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with an incomplete right bundle branch block, right ventricular hypertrophy, and subtle secondary ST-T segment changes (see ). A portable chest radiograph revealed a large-sized, right pleural effusion with mild perihilar congestion (see ). Pertinent diagnostic laboratory investigations included a D-dimer 208 ng/dL (normal ≤500 ng/mL), pro–brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) 323 pg/mL (normal ≤300 pg/mL), cardiac troponin I (cTnI) 0.08 ng/mL (normal = 0.0-0.15 ng/mL). The patient’s arterial blood gas was consistent with mild hypoxia on 24% fractional inspiration of oxygen (FiO2) with an alveolar-arterial gradient (A-a gradient) of 14 mm Hg.\n",
      "The patient was subsequently admitted for an inpatient hospitalization, and computed tomography (CT)-guided therapeutic thoracentesis was performed with a resultant hemorrhagic exudative effusion. Despite this intervention, the pleural effusion recurred within 48 hours, and cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) pleural biopsy, which later affirmed the presence of endometrial tissue on clinicopathological examination. The tentative diagnosis at this juncture was recurrent catamenial pleural effusions. On further interview, the patient acknowledged that she often experienced dyspneic episodes during menstruation.\n",
      "During the ensuing hospitalization, she continued to experience persistent shortness of breath with an episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). A 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed preserved left ventricular function with moderate right heart enlargement, septal flattening, and mild pHTN with estimated right ventricular systolic pressures of approximately 45 mm Hg. A 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiogram (2D/3D-TEE) also revealed an intact interatrial septum with agitated saline “bubble” study. The PVs were incompletely visualized and hence the rationale for further advanced imaging (see ). A cardiac CT angiogram (CCTA) affirmed the presence of the suspected PAPVC of the left inferior PV to the left brachiocephalic (innominate) vein with angiographically normal coronary arteries (see ). The patient also underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI), which demonstrated the same aberrant connection with the remaining pulmonary venous vasculature appearing dilated in addition to the RA, right ventricle, and main pulmonary artery (see and , respectively).

Her medical history also included hypothyroidism, currently treated with 150 ug Levothyroxine daily. The body mass index (BMI) on admission to prenatal care was 47 kg/m2 with length 163 centimetres (cm), weight 126 kg (kg). Apart from the obesity, her pregnancy had been without complications. She had received an intramuscular injection of Anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 + 5 weeks of gestation since she was Rhesus D (RhD) negative and the fetus was RhD positive.\n",
      "On admission, the patient described a nine-day history of shortness of breath, dry cough, myalgia, nausea, abdominal pain and fever (Fig. 1). She had significant abdominal pain on admission but the surgeon did not find any signs of an acute abdominal event. The patient had also noticed reduced fetal movements for the last two days. Obstetric examination including cardio-tocography (CTG) and an abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormalities.\n",
      "The patient’s respiratory rate was 22 breaths/minute, oxygen saturation 95%, blood pressure 116/71, pulse 113 beats/minute and temperature 37.2 degrees Celsius (oC). The laboratory tests are shown in Table . The patient was given morphine, paracetamol and oxycodone for pain relief and also received thromboprophylaxis, Dalteparin 7500 units /day subcutaneously. No additional oxygen was needed.\n",
      "On day 2 (18/4/2020), the patient was relatively stable apart from two short episodes of fever up to 38.9 oC. Due to risk for preterm labour, the patient received 12 milligrams (mg) of Betamethasone intramuscularly to aid fetal lung maturity. Daily fetal monitoring using CTG showed no signs of fetal distress.\n",
      "The patient was discharged on day 3 (19/4/2020) with a planned obstetric follow-up including fetal growth assessment after recovery. She was prescribed dalteparin for four weeks.\n",
      "The patient returned to the Emergency Department the next day (20/4/2020) with a sore throat and severe difficulties in swallowing. Apart from tachypnoea (25–35 breaths/minute) and tachycardia (118 beats/minute), other vital signs were normal. After examination, she was discharged with a prescription of Betamethasone tablets for three days (6, 4 and 3 mg) for swallowing difficulties and potassium supplements for the hypokalaemia noted in the blood tests (Table ).\n",
      "The patient was readmitted to the Infectious Diseases Department the next day (21/4/2020) (Fig. ). Her COVID-19 symptoms (cough, myalgia, abdominal pain and fever) had worsened and she now presented with dyspnoea. At readmission, the patient’s respiratory rate 42 breaths/minute, blood pressure 114/61, pulse was 120 beats/minute and temperature 38.9 oC. During episodes of coughing, her oxygen saturation fell to 86%, but with 5 L of oxygen on mask the saturation rose to 99%. Laboratory tests are shown in Table .\n",
      "Her condition deteriorated on day 2 (22/4/2020) of the readmission. In addition to the generalized pain and tenderness, the pain in her right upper abdomen had worsened. Blood tests showed elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ferritin concentrations. There was impaired coagulation as shown by a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), high D-dimer, falling platelet count and decreased level of Anti-thrombin III (Table ). Hemolysis was indicated by a fall in the hemoglobin concentration and rising lactate dehydrogenase levels although haptoglobin concentrations only were slightly elevated (Table ). Despite her worsening condition, the patient felt active fetal movements and normal intermittent CTG controls were registered. Intravenous antibiotic treatment with Cefotaxime (2 g, 3 times daily) was initiated due to suspicion of concomitant bacterial infection (Table ). Blood and urine cultures were taken but since the general condition of the patient had worsened, a decision was made to deliver by Caesarean section (32 + 6 gestational weeks), on maternal indication. The operation was performed in spinal analgesia in an operating theatre with negative air ventilation. The local hospital guidelines were followed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 []. An uncomplicated operation was completed within 40 min and the total blood loss was 200 millilitres (mL).\n",
      "After two hours in the post-operative unit, the patient returned to the ward and received thromboprophylaxis, dalteparin at a total dose of 10.000 units divided in two doses. A computed tomography (CT) lung scan, performed later the same day, showed bilateral diffuse, ground-glass opacities with both peripheral and perihilar distribution, but no signs of pulmonary embolism (Fig. ).\n",
      "Due to deranged liver values, the patient was unable to receive paracetamol and due to the COVID-19 infection not able to receive ibuprofen []. The pain relief was managed by administering 2.5 mL of intravenous morphine as needed. However, the patient’s condition worsened during the night and on examination, the patient was somnolent and lethargic but answered adequately when woken up (Reaction Level Scale 2). The patient’s pain was mostly localized to the upper right quadrant of the abdomen and epigastrium. Her uterus was well contracted and there were no signs of postoperative complications such as bleedings and local infection. On examination, the patient had miotic pupils that reacted poorly to light stimulation. Even though the patient only was given 7.5 mg of morphine over the course of 8 h, a morphine over-dose was suspected, and intravenous morphine was replaced by a combination of orally administered Naloxone and Oxycodone. Post-operative mobilization was initiated one day after surgery where after the patient made a steady recovery.\n",
      "Table illustrates the drastic improvement in the patient’s blood tests on day 3 (23/4/2020) of the readmission. The patient was discharged in good health on the 30th of April, 2020 with thromboprophylaxis planned for 6 weeks postpartum and a follow-up visit to the Obstetrics Clinic.\n",

      "This study presents a case of a 21-year-old male patient with T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma status post induction chemotherapy with lineage switch to acute myelogenous leukemia. He received high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation (TBI), and later received a matched unrelated donor blood stem cell transplantation. His post-transplant course was complicated by biopsy proven chronic graft-versus-host disease in the gastrointestinal tract requiring daily steroid use. He also developed Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis, BK virus-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, Candida glabrata fungemia, and Streptococcus viridans bacteremia-all of which were appropriately treated and resolved.\n",
      "Eleven months after his stem cell transplant, he presented with acute onset of copious blood-tinged phlegm, shortness of breath and left pleuritic chest pain. Upon initial evaluation, the patient was afebrile, respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute, pulse 180 beats per minute, blood pressure 90/67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 91% on room air. Broad-spectrum antibiotics including intravenous vancomycin and antifungals were started. The patient later was hypotensive with blood pressure of 70/46 despite aggressive intravenous hydration. Due to septic shock, intravenous norepinephrine drip was started in the intensive care unit. Laboratory studies were significant for pancytopenia with white blood cell count of 2.79 x 103 cells/µL. Intravenous steroids were started given septic shock and patient’s known history of chronic steroid use due to chronic GVHD. Electrolytes and renal function were unremarkable. Arterial blood gas was significant for PaO2 of 64 mmHg. Blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA). A chest CT scan as seen in Figure showed left lower lobe consolidation in the setting of multiple bilateral cavitary nodules.\n",
      "The infectious disease service was consulted. Blood cultures grew methicillin resistant Staphyloccocus aureus. Given the patient had not been hospitalized recently, it was determined that he had community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) bacteremia. Bronchoscopy was done and was remarkable for the presence of purulent secretions in the tracheobronchial tree. Respiratory culture from bronchoscopy also grew methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The rest of the infectious workup from the bronchoscopy was unremarkable. A transthoracic echocardiogram was ordered to evaluate for the possibility of endocarditis. The echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%, mild global hypokinesis, and no evidence of vegetation suggestive of endocarditis. After a few days of treatment, the patient had significant clinical improvement and blood cultures were negative. He was discharged with a two week course of intravenous vancomycin which he completed.\n",
      "Two months later, the patient was admitted to the hospital for fevers, productive cough with green sputum, and shortness of breath. He was found to have recurrent MRSA bacteremia and recurrent MRSA pneumonia. The CT chest findings as seen in Figure showed multiple bilateral cavitary nodules consistent with a necrotizing process.\n",
      "Initially, intravenous vancomycin was started, however this was later switched to intravenous linezolid. This was done because the patient had recurrent MRSA bacteremia despite prior intravenous vancomycin therapy. Blood cultures were negative after two days of treatment. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an improved left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-70% and no vegetations were identified. After clinical improvement, the patient was discharged on oral linezolid for six weeks per infectious disease team recommendations. After completing this course he was placed on prophylaxis with oral doxycycline to prevent further CA-MRSA infections.\n",
      "Six months later, he had a repeat CT of the chest as seen in Figure . This CT showed the presence of permanent pneumatoceles from the focal loss of lung parenchyma.\n",
      "Our patient was readmitted on several occasions mainly due to bouts of community-acquired viral pneumonia (adenovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza) along with a secondary Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. He did not have recurrent CA-MRSA pneumonia. His chest CT scan as seen in Figure from 2.5 years after the original MRSA infection demonstrated bronchiectasis and persistent pneumatoceles from his original infection with CA-MRSA.\n",
      "His initial recurrent community-acquired pneumonias with secondary MRSA and his recent recurrent episodes of pseudomonas infection suggest the patient was likely chronically colonized.\n",

Intravenous steroids were started given septic shock and patient’s known history of chronic steroid use due to chronic GVHD. Electrolytes and renal function were unremarkable. Arterial blood gas was significant for PaO2 of 64 mmHg. Blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA). A chest CT scan as seen in Figure showed left lower lobe consolidation in the setting of multiple bilateral cavitary nodules.\n",
      "The infectious disease service was consulted. Blood cultures grew methicillin resistant Staphyloccocus aureus. Given the patient had not been hospitalized recently, it was determined that he had community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) bacteremia. Bronchoscopy was done and was remarkable for the presence of purulent secretions in the tracheobronchial tree. Respiratory culture from bronchoscopy also grew methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The rest of the infectious workup from the bronchoscopy was unremarkable. A transthoracic echocardiogram was ordered to evaluate for the possibility of endocarditis. The echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%, mild global hypokinesis, and no evidence of vegetation suggestive of endocarditis. After a few days of treatment, the patient had significant clinical improvement and blood cultures were negative. He was discharged with a two week course of intravenous vancomycin which he completed.\n",
      "Two months later, the patient was admitted to the hospital for fevers, productive cough with green sputum, and shortness of breath. He was found to have recurrent MRSA bacteremia and recurrent MRSA pneumonia. The CT chest findings as seen in Figure showed multiple bilateral cavitary nodules consistent with a necrotizing process.\n",
      "Initially, intravenous vancomycin was started, however this was later switched to intravenous linezolid. This was done because the patient had recurrent MRSA bacteremia despite prior intravenous vancomycin therapy. Blood cultures were negative after two days of treatment. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an improved left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-70% and no vegetations were identified. After clinical improvement, the patient was discharged on oral linezolid for six weeks per infectious disease team recommendations. After completing this course he was placed on prophylaxis with oral doxycycline to prevent further CA-MRSA infections.\n",
      "Six months later, he had a repeat CT of the chest as seen in Figure . This CT showed the presence of permanent pneumatoceles from the focal loss of lung parenchyma.\n",
      "Our patient was readmitted on several occasions mainly due to bouts of community-acquired viral pneumonia (adenovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza) along with a secondary Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. He did not have recurrent CA-MRSA pneumonia. His chest CT scan as seen in Figure from 2.5 years after the original MRSA infection demonstrated bronchiectasis and persistent pneumatoceles from his original infection with CA-MRSA.\n",
      "His initial recurrent community-acquired pneumonias with secondary MRSA and his recent recurrent episodes of pseudomonas infection suggest the patient was likely chronically colonized.\n",

      "A 45-year-old woman with a 3-year history of chronic anemia was followed up at the Gastroenterology outpatient department of another hospital, with a 6-month history of abdominal pain. The pain was intermittent, worse in the mornings, and localized to the epigastric region. The patient noticed that her abdomen became distended after meals and distension was relieved after a bowel movement. The patient noticed a 12-kg weight loss over the last 6 months. There was a history of nausea but no vomiting. The patient denied any history of loss of appetite, diarrhea or constipation, and upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding. There was no significant past medical history other than anemia and multiple blood transfusions. The patient denied any history of tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, drug abuse, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, chronic renal failure, peptic ulcer disease, and chronic pancreatitis. Her family history was unremarkable. The patient did not have any prior surgeries or history of malignancy. Workup for her chronic anemia included CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast, which revealed duodenal intussusception. The patient was booked for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in the referral hospital but missed her appointment and asked for a referral to another hospital.\n",
      "Upon arrival at our hospital, she appeared underweight (height, 162 cm; weight, 43 kg). Her vitals were stable, and she was afebrile (blood pressure, 118/67 mm/Hg; heart rate, 96 bpm; respiratory rate, 23 bpm; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; temperature: 36.9 °C). On examination, her abdomen was soft and laxative, with no tenderness, or organomegaly. A complete blood count on the day of admission revealed the following: low hemoglobin level, 7.2 g/dL (12.0–17.0 g/dL); mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 78.0 fL (80.0–100.0 fL); low hematocrit, 24.8% (40.0%–51.0%); leukocyte count, 8.2 × 109/L (4.5-11.0 × 109/L); and platelet count, 323 × 109/L (150-450 × 109/L). Other laboratory profiles were unremarkable. Contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed significant dilation of the stomach with no detectable gastric lesion. The third part of the duodenum was distended by a sausage-shaped intraluminal structure with alternating fat planes and dilated vessels reaching up to the first part of the duodenum, suggesting retrograde jejuno-duodenal intussusception. There was no detectable soft tissue lesion, and the rest of the bowel was unremarkable (A–C). Endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract revealed a large, long, mobile submucosal longitudinal and tortuous bulge extending from the first to the second part of the duodenum that moved freely with bowel contraction. The papilla of Vater was normal with no neoplastic process.\n",
      "The patient underwent laparoscopic exploration, which revealed antiperistaltic intussusception in the proximal jejunum (). A jejunostomy was performed, and the mass was pulled through in the proximal jejunum (A).\n",
      "A cholecystectomy was performed, and a pediatric feeding tube was passed through the cystic duct to locate the ampulla of Vater. The mass was not resectable without affecting the ampulla, so the decision was made to perform a pancreas-sparing duodenal resection. The excised duodenum with mass was sent for histopathological examination (B).\n",
      "Pathological findings showed a large polypoid mass with the mucosa pedunculated from the bowel lumen, measuring 12 × 7.5 × 2.0 cm3. Microscopic examination revealed a bowel mucosa with underlying submucosa showing lobules of benign normal-appearing Brunner's glands separated by fibrous stroma. The nodular proliferation of Brunner glands was accompanied by cystically dilated ducts and adipose tissue with no microscopic features of malignancy (A–C).

Her vitals were stable, and she was afebrile (blood pressure, 118/67 mm/Hg; heart rate, 96 bpm; respiratory rate, 23 bpm; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; temperature: 36.9 °C). On examination, her abdomen was soft and laxative, with no tenderness, or organomegaly. A complete blood count on the day of admission revealed the following: low hemoglobin level, 7.2 g/dL (12.0–17.0 g/dL); mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 78.0 fL (80.0–100.0 fL); low hematocrit, 24.8% (40.0%–51.0%); leukocyte count, 8.2 × 109/L (4.5-11.0 × 109/L); and platelet count, 323 × 109/L (150-450 × 109/L). Other laboratory profiles were unremarkable. Contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed significant dilation of the stomach with no detectable gastric lesion. The third part of the duodenum was distended by a sausage-shaped intraluminal structure with alternating fat planes and dilated vessels reaching up to the first part of the duodenum, suggesting retrograde jejuno-duodenal intussusception. There was no detectable soft tissue lesion, and the rest of the bowel was unremarkable (A–C). Endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract revealed a large, long, mobile submucosal longitudinal and tortuous bulge extending from the first to the second part of the duodenum that moved freely with bowel contraction. The papilla of Vater was normal with no neoplastic process.\n",
      "The patient underwent laparoscopic exploration, which revealed antiperistaltic intussusception in the proximal jejunum (). A jejunostomy was performed, and the mass was pulled through in the proximal jejunum (A).\n",
      "A cholecystectomy was performed, and a pediatric feeding tube was passed through the cystic duct to locate the ampulla of Vater. The mass was not resectable without affecting the ampulla, so the decision was made to perform a pancreas-sparing duodenal resection. The excised duodenum with mass was sent for histopathological examination (B).\n",
      "Pathological findings showed a large polypoid mass with the mucosa pedunculated from the bowel lumen, measuring 12 × 7.5 × 2.0 cm3. Microscopic examination revealed a bowel mucosa with underlying submucosa showing lobules of benign normal-appearing Brunner's glands separated by fibrous stroma. The nodular proliferation of Brunner glands was accompanied by cystically dilated ducts and adipose tissue with no microscopic features of malignancy (A–C). The patient was discharged postoperatively in good condition, given an appointment after 1 month.\n",

      "A 73-year-old female patient, who was hospitalized since 3 months, presented with complaints of paroxysmal dry cough since 2 weeks. The patient was admitted initially due to progressive dyspnea. Respiratory distress occurred 2 days later and she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) after intubation for mechanical ventilation. Her past medical history included hypertension and diabetes mellitus for approximately 20 years; both of which were in a stable condition with regular medication. Six months before admission, she underwent a median sternotomy and thymectomy for thymoma. She denied having a recent travel history aboard but reported contact with a large pigeon population as there was a large dovecot near her residence. A series of examinations were performed for the unexplained respiratory failure, and myasthenic crisis was diagnosed based on high levels of acetylcholine receptor antibodies (> 4 nmol/L) and neurophysiological study findings. Consequently, she received several courses of plasma exchange followed by a high dose of prednisolone (30 mg daily) and azathioprine (25 mg daily) to treat the myasthenic crisis. Her respiratory condition improved after the therapy. She was transferred to the general ward after successfully weaning off mechanical ventilation. Oral prednisolone and azathioprine therapy was continued. After receiving prednisolone and azathioprine therapy for nearly 3 months, she developed dry cough. Physical examination revealed that respiratory rate was 15 breaths/min, blood pressure was 140/88 mmHg, heart rate was 80 beats/min, and body temperature was in the normal range. The remainder of the examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, and other organ systems was unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation included a peripheral white blood cell count of 8870/µL; hemoglobin, 10.8 g/dL; and platelet count of 299,000/µL. Her serum alanine aminotransferase level was 9 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase level was 19 U/L; blood urea nitrogen level was 13 mg/dL; creatinine level was 0.3 mg/dL; level of procalcitonin was 0.1 ng/Ml, and level of C-reactive protein was 1.78 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis (with the patient breathing ambient air) revealed pH 7.47, PaCO2 56.9 mmHg, PaO2 66.7 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 99%.\n",
      "A thoracic CT scan was performed. On comparing it with the previous thoracic CT scan performed on admission (Fig. a), a newly developed 2-cm consolidative nodule was observed on the upper lobe of the left lung (Fig. b). Serum aspergillus galactomannan antigen testing, fungus stain and fungus culture of sputum, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of sputum for mycobacterium tuberculosis were all negative. The CT-guided biopsy was performed, and its pathology revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells engulfing thick-wall micro-organisms (Fig. a). These organisms were 4–6 microns in diameter, stains bright red with Periodic Acid Schiff (Fig. b) and black in Gomori Methenamine-Silver (Fig. c), consistent with those of cryptococcus. A subsequent serum titer of cryptococcal antigen was 1:8 using Remel Cryptococcus Antigen Test Kit (Remel, Lenexa, KS, USA). Because there were no neurologic symptoms and signs indicated cryptococcus meningoencephalitis, lumbar puncture was not performed. Immune status of the patient was then assessed. Except for recent immunosuppressive therapy for the myasthenic crisis, the patient revealed no evidence of malignancy or vasculitis, and human immunodeficiency virus testing was negative. To determine the possibility of cross transmission from infected patients, we reviewed the incidence of cryptococcal infection cases in the ICU and the general ward for up to 1 month before the patient was diagnosed, but no new cryptococcal infection cases were reported. Intravenous fluconazole, 400 mg daily, was administered for pulmonary cryptococcal infection for 14 days. Respiratory symptoms nearly resolved after treatment and the patient was discharged for outpatient follow-up with continuation of oral fluconazole 400 mg daily. The chest CT scan, 3 months after discharge, revealed complete clearance of the lesion (Fig. c) and the relevant inflammatory biomarkers were in the normal range. No recurrence of the Cryptococcal infection has occurred to date.\n",

      "A 75-year-old female presented to the emergency department with dyspnoea. She had been treated for recurrent lower respiratory tract infections by the general practitioner (GP) with oral antibiotics (12 cases in the past 14 months). Her relevant medical history included chronic kidney disease stage 3 (baseline creatinine 80–110 µmol/L), polymyalgia rheumatica requiring long-term steroids, asthma and chronic back pain. The pneumonia diagnosis was confirmed by a chest radiograph and CT showing multifocal nodular consolidation in the right lower lobe with cavitations and blood cultures were taken that grew Staphylococcus aureus.\n",
      "Her medical history otherwise included depression, hypercholesterolaemia, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, spondylosis, glaucoma, hypertension, lacunar stroke, transient ischaemic attack, vitamin B12 deficiency and vascular dementia.\n",
      "Her long-term treatment included hydromorphone, paracetamol, topiramate, paracetamol–codeine–doxylamine, doxylamine, colecalciferol, aspirin, duloxetine, pantoprazole, prednisolone, docusate, macrogol, hydroxocobalamin, salbutamol and denosumab.\n",
      "On presentation, she was initially afebrile, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 96%. On examination, there were crackles on the right base, dual heart sounds with no murmurs and no peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis. She was subsequently treated for pneumonia and urinary tract infection with intravenous piperacillin–tazobactam. The working diagnosis was S. aureus bacteraemia secondary to a pulmonary source.\n",
      "The patient was transferred to the closest tertiary hospital as the eventual need for further investigations, including a trans-oesophageal echo, was anticipated in the context of S. aureus bacteraemia. The treatment of her bacteraemia was eventually changed to intravenous flucloxacillin (2 g four times daily) once sensitivities were confirmed. Flucloxacillin was planned to continue for a further 5 weeks via peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) on an 8 g/24 hours infuser that was monitored via hospital in the home (HITH).\n",
      "Four weeks into the HITH treatment, the patient developed nausea and was investigated with blood results that showed worsening renal function associated with HAGMA. She was subsequently referred back to the regional hospital. Her heart rate was 105 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and O2 sat 98% on room air. At that point, HAGMA was attributed to an acute kidney injury (AKI). Following adequate fluid resuscitation, HAGMA and AKI persisted. She was investigated for the AKI with a renal ultrasound which was negative and there were no eosinophils found in the urine. Interstitial nephritis secondary to flucloxacillin use was considered as another reason for her AKI but was deemed unlikely. The treatment plan was to commence sodium bicarbonate 840 mg once daily following consultation with the renal team. Ultimately, further investigations for the AKI were completed at the tertiary hospital. The HAGMA was suspected to be caused by the concurrent use of flucloxacillin and paracetamol. As a result of this, flucloxacillin was changed to cefazolin and the patient transferred again to a tertiary facility pending further investigations as well as suspected pulmonary embolism following reports of chest pain.\n",

      "A dyspneic 69-year-old male was referred for further management to our tertiary referral hospital with suspicion of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. He suffered typical chest pain, diaphoresis, and an anterior myocardial infarction 3 days before admission to our hospital and was treated with streptokinase in a general medical center. He also underwent dopamine and dobutamine therapy in that center because of a significant reduction in his blood pressure.\n",
      "On admission, he had a pulse rate of 105 bpm, a blood pressure of 80/65 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 25 (O2 saturation = 92%). On physical examination, he had muffled heart sounds and a fine crackle in the lower two-thirds of both lungs. His jugular venous pressure was higher than normal, and his electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with significant Q waves in V1 through V6 precordial leads.\n",
      "Initial transthoracic echocardiography showed a severe abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF = 20%) with a massive pericardial effusion with hemodynamic effect (right ventricular outflow tract collapse). The results were highly suggestive for rupture of the apical septal myocardium with clot formation.\n",
      "The operation was performed through a standard median sternotomy. The proximal part of pericardium was partially opened, and a controlled amount of blood was removed gradually, which immediately improved his hemodynamic indices. Standard cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was performed with mild hypothermia (32°C) and standard cardioplegic myocardial preservation. The heart was arrested, and the pericardium was opened completely. Thereafter, the remaining blood was drained. A large myocardial infarction in the apex was seen, and the sub-epicardial hematoma extended to the lateral side of left and right ventricular free wall. This resulted in intramural perforation of the apex (). The distal part of the LAD was inside the hematoma and was not suitable for graft anastomosis. Under dry conditions, a 95 × 48 mm piece of TachoSil® patch was positioned on the area and was pressed to the surface of the ventricle for 5 minutes. This was repeated two times after which no bleeding was observed. Thereafter, a large autologous pericardial patch was fixed over the surface covered by TachoSil® fleece far from fragile necrotic tissue with a few separate 6 - 0 Prolene sutures to obtain maximal adhesion to the epicardial surface. Finally, a generous Teflon felt patch was sewn over all previous patches to reinforce adhesion and avoid blood oozing (). The aortic cross-clamp was released, and the patient was weaned from CPB after normothermia with normal sinus rhythm, epinephrine, and insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump. The CPB and aortic cross-clamp times were 112 and 47 minutes, respectively. No bleeding occurred during the follow-up period.\n",

      "A 28-year-old man was admitted in our hospital on Jul 13, 2018 because of recurrent cough and yellow-phlegm accompanied by fever for more than 10 months. The symptoms were repeated after routine symptomatic treatment. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan taken in January 2018 had showed that his right lung was spotted by small piece of shadow, accompanied by a cavity. The patient refused to initiate antitubercular therapy. The symptoms were improved after self-administration of cephalosporin as anti-infection treatment for 1 week. In May, the cough and sputum were aggravated, accompanied by fever in the afternoon, with body temperature around 38 °C. In the beginning of July, chest CT showed that the patchy shadow was scattered in two lungs with multiple cavities. The large consolidation in the right upper lung was significantly progressed compared with half a year ago. Considering combination of pulmonary tuberculosis and pulmonary infection, he was hospitalized.\n",
      "At admission, physical examination revealed the following: weight 53 kg; BMI 16.7, body temperature 38.7 °C, pulse 85/min, blood pressure 118/72 mmHg, finger oxygen saturation degree (FOSD) 98%. The lungs had lower breath sounds, with no obvious dry or wet rale. The auxiliary examination showed that the following test items were normal, including blood routine, biochemistry, coagulation, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, arterial blood gas analysis and echocardiography. D-dimer was 13.17 mg/L. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. The details of chest CT was shown in Fig. . Acid-fast bacilli staining test for sputum sample was positive (4+/3+), which confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.\n",
      "Routine anti-tuberculosis regimen was initiated, including isoniazid (300 mg/day), rifampin (450 mg/day), pyrazinamide (1500 mg/day) and ethambutol (750 mg/day). After 3 days of treatment, the body temperature dropped down to the normal, and the cough was relieved. Respiratory symptoms were also improved after 15 days of treatment. At that time, the patient suddenly felt chest tightness, chest pain, and shortness of breath after increased activity (three times more than the usual). Physical examination revealed: heart beats 138/m, blood pressure 88/58 mmHg, FOSD 86%. Even after 6 L high-flow oxygen intake, FOSD was maintained at 90%. Arterial blood gas analysis without oxygen inhalation indicated: pH 7.44, PO2 48 mmHg, PCO2 33 mmHg, SPO2 86%, Oxygenation Index 228.57 mmHg, D-dimer 14.03 mg/L. Electrocardiogram showed atrial tachycardia, non-specific ST elevation. Taking together, all the data highly suggested PTE. Emergency computer tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) inspection showed signs of filling defects in the trunk and branches of the left pulmonary artery and the right lower pulmonary artery (Fig. ).\n",
      "According to the CTPA result, the patient was diagnosed as a large-scale PTE, and the risk stratification was medium-high. The patient was prescribed with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (0.1 mL/10 kg) for anticoagulation. Then, under pulmonary angiography, a combined thrombolytic therapy including mechanical thrombolysis, aspiration, and topical urokinase (300,000 U) was applied to the left pulmonary artery. Fortunately, as shown in Fig. , the filling defect of left pulmonary artery disappeared. After the interventional therapy, the patient received intravenous pumping of 20,000 U urokinase every 1 h for 24 h. The symptoms of chest tightness, chest pain and shortness of breath were significantly improved, while the blood oxygen saturation and blood pressure returned to normal, and the vital signs were stable. Neither hemoptysis nor gastrointestinal bleeding occurred during the period of thrombolysis. The deep vein B-ultrasound of double lower limbs was performed and found a flocculent echo in the superior cavity of the upper right femoral vein, and extended into the external iliac vein. Then protein C, protein S activity, coagulation factor V leiden mutation, prothrombin 20210A, lupus anticoagulant, homocysteine, were determined and no abnormality was found. Anti-tuberculosis and warfarin anticoagulant therapy were continued, and international normalized ratio (INR) value was monitored and adjusted between 2 and 3. The patient was discharged with self-administration of oral anti-TB drugs and anticoagulant drug. At follow-up after 20 days of discharge, B-ultrasound showed that the deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of right lower extremity of the patient disappeared. At follow-up of 4 months, the patient was re-examined with chest enhanced CT in the outpatient department of our hospital and no obvious emboli was found.\n",

      "A 15-year-old female presented in preanesthetic checkup clinic for rush nail removal of femur. She was a known case of OI type I and history of recurrent fractures for which she had been operated three times uneventfully under general anesthesia. There was no history of OI in the family.\n",
      "On general examination, she was short statured with a height of 103 cm, weighing 49 kg, blue sclera, fragile bones, progressive hearing loss, kyphoscoliosis. Her blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, and heart rate was 80 beats/min. There was no pallor, icterus, cyanosis, clubbing, lymphadenopathy, or pedal edema. Respiratory system revealed barrel-shaped chest with bilateral equal air entry, and cardiovascular system revealed normal heart sounds. Electrocardiogram (ECG), liver function test, renal function test, and coagulation profile were normal. Chest X-ray was normal except mediastinal widening; X-ray of the spine revealed dorsolumbar kyphoscoliosis to the left. Pulmonary function test was suggestive of mildly restrictive disease. Airway assessment showed acceptable flexion and extension at neck with adequate mouth opening and normal dentition, Mallampatti Class III. The patient was accepted for surgery as American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade III; in view odontoaxial dislocation and normal coagulation profile, we decided to proceed with a spinal anesthetic technique. Thorough operating room preparation was completed including difficult airway equipment, and measures made ready to deal with hyperthermias if any.\n",

      "A 46 years old female with a history of unspecified arthritis presented to the emergency department with complaints of substernal chest pain and right leg numbness of one-hour duration. The chest pain was radiating to the left shoulder and was associated with diaphoresis and dyspnea. On examination, vitals revealed a blood pressure of 92/69 mmHg, heart rate of 54/min, oxygen saturation of 100% on room air, and afebrile at 98.3°F. There was a soft systolic murmur in the right upper sternal border. Pulsation on dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery and sensation on right lower extremity was decreased. Electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed complete heart block with junctional escape rhythm and ST elevation in anterior precordial leads with ST depression in leads I and aVL (Figure ). Pertinent labs revealed initial troponin-I of 0.05 ng/ml. The remaining blood work, including complete blood count and the basic metabolic panel, was unremarkable.\n",
      "In the emergency department, the patient received immediate dual antiplatelet therapy, and cutaneous pacer pads were applied. Due to the focal exam findings, a computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) was performed rapidly with quick review ruling out dissection. CTA however revealed a small transverse, linear defect in the proximal aorta (Figure ). This defect was noted to propagate towards the root of the aortic valve on its anterior leaflet suggesting possible vegetation on the aortic valve. Given the ST changes and ongoing chest pain, the patient was taken immediately for cardiac catheterization which revealed a distal thrombus in the posterior left ventricular branch of the right coronary artery which was not amenable for intervention (Figures , ). During cardiac catheterization, right lower extremity pain and coolness suddenly worsened. Angiogram of the right lower extremity showed 100% occlusion of the right anterior and posterior tibial arteries (Figure ). The patient then went for emergent thrombo-embolectomy of the right tibio-peroneal trunk, with a marked resolution of symptoms. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed later confirming the vegetation in the aortic valve measuring about 6.5x4.0 mm (Figure ). Three sets of blood cultures were negative. Significant remarkable lab findings included C-reactive protein (CRP) of 10.5 ng/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 60 mm/hr, and positive rheumatoid arthritis screen. Extensive rheumatological and hypercoagulable workup including anti-nuclear antibodies, complement levels, anti-thrombin III activity, protein C & S levels, homocysteine levels, and other procoagulant markers were within the normal range. Specific testing for systemic scleroderma, Sjogren’s, and polymyositis were also unremarkable. Confirmatory testing with anti-cyclic citrullinated protein showed levels of >250 units establishing the diagnosis of RA.

      "The white blood cell count was 11.2 109/L. Arterial blood gas revealed the following: pH 7.410, pCO2 37.2 mmHg, pO2 104 mmHg on 100% FiO2. Chest radiograph demonstrated right middle and lower lobe infiltrates (Figure ) []. Chest computed tomography (CT) with contrast showed patchy airspace disease and air bronchograms in the aforementioned areas with a right infrahilar mass measuring 3.3 × 2.6 cm near the right middle lobe bronchi (Figure ) [].\n",
      "He was admitted to the intensive care unit, ultimately requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Sputum and blood cultures drawn on admission revealed no growth. A repeat chest radiograph demonstrated the development of a pleural effusion, felt to be parapneumonic. A thoracentesis was performed with removal of 300 cc of yellow-colored fluid []. Pleural fluid analysis was exudative with a negative gram stain and culture. Bronchoscopy demonstrated friable mucosa in the bronchi of the right middle and lower lobes []. Purulent fluid was noted, which was suggestive of abscess formation. Gram stain of the aspirated fluid was remarkable for white blood cells without organisms.\n",
      "The patient underwent thoracotomy with right middle lobe resection []. Surgical pathology revealed extensive acute and chronic inflammation with lipoid droplets, extensive necrosis, and obliteration of alveolar spaces. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of necrotizing lipoid pneumonia with abscess formation following hydrocarbon aspiration. The patient’s hospitalization was further complicated by an acute cerebellar stroke. He required tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. He was ultimately discharged to a long-term acute care hospital.\n",

      "A 73-year-old woman presented with three days of progressively worsening sharp non-radiating reproducible left-sided thoracic pain exacerbated by movement of the ipsilateral upper extremity. Her past medical history was significant for a myocardial infarction two decades prior with resultant ischemic cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and a biventricular pacemaker and defibrillator in place. Initial examination revealed normal vital signs, non-distended neck veins, and left-sided chest wall tenderness to palpation. Electrocardiography displayed a ventricular-paced rhythm and left bundle branch block not meeting the Sgarbossa criteria for ischemia. Three serial troponin I assays were negative. Chest radiograph showed dual chamber pacer wires in place without cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusions. Biventricular pacemaker interrogation revealed no arrhythmic events but indicated the need for battery replacement. Her symptoms were attributed to noncardiac musculoskeletal chest pain, and she was discharged home with plans for elective pacemaker battery replacement.\n",
      "Two weeks later, the patient presented with dyspnea, orthopnea, and retrosternal chest pain. On physical examination, the patient was afebrile, and she had a blood pressure of 172/64 mmHg, pulse rate of 67 beats/minute, and respiration rate of 18 breaths/minute. Her oxygen saturation was 99% on 3 L of oxygen per minute. Cardiac examination revealed non-distended neck veins, normal heart sounds, diminished bilateral lung sounds, and mild bilateral pedal edema. Electrocardiogram was similar to the prior, and serial cardiac enzymes were normal. The brain natriuretic peptide level was elevated at 2,042 pg/mL. Chest radiograph showed increased vascular markings and cardiomegaly. Immediate intravenous loop diuretics and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation were initiated with symptomatic improvement. In the setting of unstable angina with decompensated heart failure, urgent cardiac catheterization was performed, revealing a totally occluded right coronary artery, normal left coronaries, and a calcified, well-demarcated, large left ventricular infero-basal aneurysm with a 28 mm neck opening (Figure ). Cardiac computed tomography with angiography (Figures and 3) and transesophageal echocardiography (Figure ) showed a 46 x 45 x 47 mm aneurysm originating just at the takeoff of the posterior mitral valve leaflet (increased in size when compared with prior images) and severe mitral regurgitation. The patient underwent surgical mitral valve repair, aneurysmectomy, and pericardial patching. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 30%-35% to 40%-45% postoperatively. Following the initial recovery period, the patient reported better exercise tolerance and improved quality of life, and she did not require further heart failure or angina-related hospitalizations to date.\n",

It was not associated with any alleviating or aggravating factors. On the day of presentation, she became lightheaded and experience shortness of breath. The discomfort was associated with two episodes of nonbloody emesis and left-sided pleuritic chest pain. She did not have any retrosternal chest pain, diaphoresis, or syncopal episode. She was, additionally, complaining of right lower leg cramping. Her medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and deep vein thrombosis, which was treated with an oral anticoagulant for six months. The initial vitals were blood pressure of 125/62 mmHg, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air; she was afebrile. The cardiopulmonary exam was unremarkable. The initial troponin level was 0.02 ng/mL (normal: 0–0.10 ng/mL), eight hours apart. The pro-BNP level was at 7511 pg/mL (normal: 50–92 pg/mL). An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without significant findings. A CT-chest with contrast showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary emboli in the right and left main pulmonary arteries and straightening of the interventricular septum suggestive of right ventricular strain (). The echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction, hypokinetic RV, mild pulmonary hypertension (RVSP of 49 mmHg), and RV/LV > 1 ().

      "A 29-year-old man presented to the emergency department after one week of repeated bouts of crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea, which became bloody on the day of arrival. There was no fever, nausea, or vomiting.\n",
      "He was evaluated several times in the Emergency Medicine Department during the previous three months, with various abdominal complaints that resolved after symptomatic relief without further investigation. The patient reported no additional symptoms or relevant personal or familial medical history. He worked as a bus driver, smoked cigarettes for many years, and did not drink alcohol regularly.\n",
      "The patient reported daily usage of “Mr. Nice Guy” for the last few months but denied use of any other drugs or supplements. Consumption of SCs was via smoking, and he denied other means of administration such as oral or intravenous. This information was validated by collateral anamnesis of visiting friends.\n",
      "In the emergency department, the patient was hemodynamically stable with initial BP recordings of 159/100 mmHg, regular heart rate of 99 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 99% on ambient air. Physical examination was unremarkable except for intense borborygmi and mild abnormal tenderness. Initial blood work showed leukocytosis of 20,000 cells/mcL with neutrophilia (80%) and normal hemoglobin (15.1 grams/dL). Biochemistry, including electrolytes, kidney function tests, liver, and pancreatic enzymes, were all within normal limits. Urinalysis was unremarkable, and urine toxicology screen was slightly positive for amphetamines and benzodiazepines but negative for other screened drugs including THC, opiates, and cocaine. Upon repeated questioning, patient once again denied use of any other stimulant including amphetamines, besides “Mr. Nice Guy.” White cell count increased to 28,000 cells/mcL six hours later, and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) performed without IV or PO contrast enhancement was unremarkable. Over the next four days the patient continued to complain of intermittent episodes of crampy abdominal pain with episodic diarrhea, followed by pain-free periods during which he strolled freely around the hospital, admitting that he was still smoking “Mr. Nice Guy,” provided to him by his friends. Additional toxic screens were not performed during hospitalization due to lack of the patient's cooperation. Leukocytosis gradually resolved.

      "A 29-year-old man presented to the emergency department after one week of repeated bouts of crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea, which became bloody on the day of arrival. There was no fever, nausea, or vomiting.\n",
      "He was evaluated several times in the Emergency Medicine Department during the previous three months, with various abdominal complaints that resolved after symptomatic relief without further investigation. The patient reported no additional symptoms or relevant personal or familial medical history. He worked as a bus driver, smoked cigarettes for many years, and did not drink alcohol regularly.\n",
      "The patient reported daily usage of “Mr. Nice Guy” for the last few months but denied use of any other drugs or supplements. Consumption of SCs was via smoking, and he denied other means of administration such as oral or intravenous. This information was validated by collateral anamnesis of visiting friends.\n",
      "In the emergency department, the patient was hemodynamically stable with initial BP recordings of 159/100 mmHg, regular heart rate of 99 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 99% on ambient air. Physical examination was unremarkable except for intense borborygmi and mild abnormal tenderness. Initial blood work showed leukocytosis of 20,000 cells/mcL with neutrophilia (80%) and normal hemoglobin (15.1 grams/dL). Biochemistry, including electrolytes, kidney function tests, liver, and pancreatic enzymes, were all within normal limits. Urinalysis was unremarkable, and urine toxicology screen was slightly positive for amphetamines and benzodiazepines but negative for other screened drugs including THC, opiates, and cocaine. Upon repeated questioning, patient once again denied use of any other stimulant including amphetamines, besides “Mr. Nice Guy.” White cell count increased to 28,000 cells/mcL six hours later, and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) performed without IV or PO contrast enhancement was unremarkable. Over the next four days the patient continued to complain of intermittent episodes of crampy abdominal pain with episodic diarrhea, followed by pain-free periods during which he strolled freely around the hospital, admitting that he was still smoking “Mr. Nice Guy,” provided to him by his friends. Additional toxic screens were not performed during hospitalization due to lack of the patient's cooperation. Leukocytosis gradually resolved. Blood, stool, and urinary cultures were negative and other laboratory data were unremarkable, with the exception of hypophosphatemia (0.5 mmol/L, normal = 0.8–1.4) and increasing C-reactive protein (22 mg/dL, normal < 0.5 mg/dL).

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 68-year-old man attended the Accident and Emergency department with increasing breathlessness but no chest pain, sputum production or haemoptysis. He had recently returned from holiday in Spain and his general practitioner prescribed amoxicillin for a presumed chest infection. He was a diet-controlled type 2 diabetic on treatment for hypertension. He had a 40-pack-year smoking history and had lost 4 kg in weight. Examination revealed an obese man with normal blood pressure, sinus tachycardia at 100 beats⋅min−1, with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths⋅min−1. His oxygen saturation was 96% on air. His white cell count was 11×109 cells⋅L−1 and C-reactive protein was 92 mg⋅L−1. Renal function and coagulation studies were normal.\n",
      "The admitting medical team felt that there was a “complete whiteout” of the left hemithorax and initially treated him for suspected severe community-­acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics and fluids, while arranging a respiratory opinion. Prophylactic low molecular weight ­heparin (LMWH) was also started. The respiratory team felt that an underlying malignancy may have been responsible for the radiographic appearances of left upper lobe collapse and suggested a ­computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax. shows a “veil-like” opacity projected over the left lung field, a raised left hemidiaphragm with blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with left upper lobe collapse, volume loss and an associated pleural effusion.\n",
      "The CT scan showed a large left hilar mass coalescing with the left upper lobe collapse. There were associated large para-aortic, subcarinal, mediastinal and supraclavicular nodes, a single liver metastasis and a second separate mass in the right lung. Lung cancer staging was T4N3M1b.\n",
      "It was interesting to note that a separate mass was present in the right lung (c). He did have metastatic disease but this might represent a synchronous primary, although by strict definition, to diagnose this, we needed to prove that the second mass was of different histology to the primary mass or that it was of the same histology but with no mediastinal or metastatic spread [].\n",
      "While awaiting a bronchoscopy, the patient coughed up ∼600 mL of fresh blood in 12 h, with worsening hypoxia. Repeat full blood count and coagulation studies were normal.\n",
      "The patient was having massive haemoptysis, defined as coughing up anything between 100 mL and 600 mL of fresh blood in 24 h [].\n",
      "He was seen by the on-call medical team and sat upright. Two large-bore cannulae were inserted in case of exsanguination. Sitting upright runs the risk of the blood spilling over into the normal lung. “Drowning” by filling up the bronchial tree with blood tends to occur before any true haemodynamic instability due to volume loss. As such, the mainstay of treatment in massive haem­optysis is to protect the normal lung and try to stop the bleeding [, ].\n",
      "The respiratory team felt that a palliative approach was too premature, but it was explained to him that his prognosis was poor with limited treatment options available. He agreed to a “do not resuscitate” plan. A treatment escalation plan was agreed to ensure his treatment was limited to level 2 care. Hypoxia precluded a bronchoscopy or transfer to the local cardiothoracic centre. Bronchoscopic strategies to control pulmonary haemorrhage include balloon tamponade, iced saline lavage, administration of a topical vasoconstrictor or coagulant, laser therapy and electrocautery [].\n",
      "The patient pointed to his left hemithorax when asked which side he felt the bleeding was coming from. Anecdotal experience suggests that patients with haemoptysis can often accurately indicate the side of the bleeding lesion. He was therefore positioned on his left side and tranexamic acid was administered intravenously. A pilot study evaluating the effect of tranexamic acid and the related antifibrinolytic agent aminocaproic acid included three patients with haemoptysis due to lung cancer []. All three patients experienced cessation of bleeding within 1–4 days without any recurrence. Patients received 1.5 g of intravenous tranexamic acid initially, followed by 1 g three times per day for a week after cessation of bleeding. The use of tranexamic acid in bleeding has been recognised for a long time [] and tranexamic acid may reduce both the duration and volume of bleeding, with low risk of short-term thromboembolic complications [].\n",
      "His haemoptysis and hypoxia improved over the ensuing days, and at bronchoscopy an organised clot was visualised in the left upper lobe bronchus with no endobronchial masses and a normal right bronchial tree. Left upper lobe lavage revealed no malignant cells on cytology. At endobronchial ultrasound examination, a large paratracheal node was sampled and histology demonstrated a poorly differentiated necrotic squamous cell carcinoma.\n",
      "The patient’s clinical condition slowly improved until 15 days into his admission, when overnight he developed acute dyspnoea with tachycardia at 120 beats⋅min−1. Arterial blood gas sampling measured his arterial oxygen tension (PaO) at 7.0 kPa on high flow oxygen via a reservoir bag, and an arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO) of 5.1 kPa. A repeat chest radiograph showed no change.\n",
      "The PA–aO is a measure of the difference between the alveolar concentration (A) of oxygen and the arterial (a) concentration of oxygen. In room air (inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.21) at sea level (atmospheric pressure of 760 mmHg) assuming 100% humidity in the alveoli, a simplified version of the equation is 21−((PaCO/0.8)−PaO), 0.8 being the respiratory quotient.\n",
      "High flow oxygen delivers ∼85% oxygen, so 85−(5.1/0.8)−7=71.625, which is significantly raised. While his PA–aO was likely to be raised due to his cancer/effusion, such a disparity and the clinical picture points towards the possibility of a pulmonary embolus. The use of the PA–aO is a useful adjunct in diagnosis []. There are numerous case reports about tranexamic acid increasing the risk of pulmonary emboli [, ]. In this case, the patient had other significant risk factors such as disseminated malignancy and a prolonged period of immobility.\n",
      "The patient understood that if left untreated, a large pulmonary embolus may prove fatal, but by treating it with anticoagulation, a major fatal haemoptysis was also more likely. He agreed to receive LMWH together with morphine for symptoms of dyspnoea and agitation. 6 h later, he had improved clinically and was able to safely lie flat briefly for a CT pulmonary angiogram. This confirmed large right-sided pulmonary emboli with associated right heart strain with reflux of contrast into the venous circulation (). The option of inferior vena cava filter insertion to prevent further embolic events was not available in our hospital, and he was too unstable to be transferred to an appropriate tertiary hospital. Over the following 2 days, urgent palliative radiotherapy to the left-sided tumour was arranged. After he had received a single fraction, further large volume haemoptysis recurred. LMWH was stopped and tranexamic acid restarted. The bleeding settled once more and he completed five fractions of radiotherapy. Slowly his oxygen saturations improved to 93% on air and he was discharged home on long-term full-dose LMWH with no recurrence of the haem­optysis.\n",
      "He presented 3 weeks later with progressive respiratory failure and his symptoms were palliated according to his wishes.\n",

Three years before current presentation, bilateral hystero-salpingo-ovoforectomy, was performed. About 2 months ago, routine clinical examination by her oncologists revealed left axillary lymphadenopathy (2 × 3 cm) with fixed, firm and nontender node and an additional fixed mass (1 × 3 cm) in the anterior left forearm. Both lesions were excisionally biopsied. Further Imaging showed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and multiple metastatic lesions in the liver & abdomen and chest. PET scan showed 2 metastatic lesions in brain.\n",

One day after the first dose of Herceptin and Perjecta and the fourth dose of Gemcitabin and Paclitaxel, the right lower extremity swelling developed and subsequent Compression ultrasound and Doppler studies revealed acute extensive thrombus formation in the superficial femoral vein of the right leg.

      "A 26-year-old female presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of dyspnea and left precordial pain of 6 hr duration. She had no history of exertional dyspnea, fever, weight loss, prolonged immobilization, syncope, focal neurological deficits, substance abuse, endocrine disorders and dermatological ailments in the past. She had no family history of cardiac disorders, including cardiac tumors. The patient's physical examination revealed blood pressure of 94/60 mmHg, heart rate of 120 beats/min, respiratory rate of 40/min, elevated jugular venous pressure with prominent ‘v’ wave. On cardiovascular system examination, S1 was normal, S2 was narrowly split with loud P2; a pan-systolic murmur of grade III/VI intensity was present along left sternal border. Tumor plop was audible. Chest was clear on auscultation. Abdominal examination was normal. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, right axis deviation and QR in V1 lead. Pulse oximetry revealed a saturation of 85% at room air increasing to 90% with 100% oxygen at 6 L/min. Laboratory examination revealed hemoglobin - 12.6 g/dl, total leukocytes count - 12.600/µL and platelet count of 1,00,000/µL. Liver function tests and renal function tests were normal. Chest roentgenogram was unremarkable.\n",
      "Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a large pedunculated mobile mass in RA with heterogenous echotexture attached to RA free wall and another mass attached to interatrial septum near fossa ovalis []. Another mass was seen in RV measuring 11 mm × 11 mm just beneath the septal leaflet of tricuspid valve []. Larger RA mass was prolapsing into RV producing severe eccentric TR jet with a gradient of 60 mmHg [, supplementary movie 1]. RV outflow tract and PA was dilated []. Inferior vena cava was free of any mass or thrombus (supplementary movie 2). HRCT thorax revealed embolization to the lateral aspect of right PA and along the medial aspect of left PA causing subtotal obstruction with pulmonary infarct in left lung [Figure and ]. Ultrasonography of abdomen and bilateral lower limb Doppler was unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen was normal.\n",
      "Once the diagnosis of multicentric RA and RV myxoma with tumor fragment embolization to PA was made, emergency surgery was performed by standard median sternotomy and cardio-pulmonary bypass using bicaval and ascending aortic cannulation to prevent further embolic events. Systemic hypothermia was used, and cardioplegia was administered for myocardial protection. The RA was then opened and a round lobulated mass measuring 3 cm × 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm was found attached to the RA free wall by a pedicle. Another mass attached to interatrial septum near fossa ovalis was excised. Multiple degenerating tumor strands were detected in RA, which were not visualized by transthoracic echocardiography.

      "Our patient is an otherwise previously healthy, active, nonsmoking, 40-year-old male who presented to an outside hospital on April 2, 2020, with a 7-day history of fevers (Tmax: 102.7°F, 39.3C) and worsening shortness of breath. On presentation, he was saturating 80% on room air, which improved to 96% with 6 l of the nasal cannula. His other vitals at presentation included: heart rate of 87 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, the temperature of 39.1C, and blood pressure of 135/60 mmHg. His height was 188 cm, weight 87.7 kg, and body mass index was 25. His C-reactive protein (CRP) was 19.8 mg/dL (normal: 0.3–1.0 mg/dL). Other admission laboratories included a point of care troponin (normal, 0.0 ng/ml), creatinine of 1.17 mg/dL, carbon dioxide of 27 mmol/L, procalcitonin of 0.31 ng/ml, lactic acid of 1.5 mmol/L, normal liver transaminases, normal prothrombin time, white blood cell count (8.9 10^9/L) and differential, hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL. No D-Dimer or brain natriuretic peptide testing was performed and per the initial assessment, since there were no complaints of leg swelling, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was not performed, however, a chest X-ray demonstrated “multi-focal consolidation most consistent with typical viral bronchopneumonia” []. No other source of bacterial infection or cause of acute respiratory failure was identified, and a COVID polymerase chain reaction test was positive. He required mechanical ventilation (initial setting: rate: 24/min; positive end-expiratory pressure: 14 mmHg; peak inspiratory pressure: 31 mmHg; tidal volume: 460 ml; FIO2: 0.70) the following day with a CRP of 23.6 mg/dL and a ferritin of 1039 ng/mL (normal: 38–380 ng/mL). His COVID-19 therapies are listed in . D-Dimer testing on April 9th was elevated to 5.25 mg/L.\n",
      "However, due to the worsening of his respiratory failure, including poor response to prone positioning and inhaled nitric oxide (40 parts/million), he was transferred to our institution for ECMO on April 7, 2020 []. On arrival, he was immediately assessed by our ECMO Team (respiratory ECMO survival prediction score: 3, Class II risk, 76% predicted survival)[] and placed on percutaneous veno-veno ECMO at the bedside (21 Fr single-stage inflow, 25 Fr multi-stage drainage cannulas with Maquet CardioHelp circuit (Maquet Cardiovascular, Wayne NJ USA). ECMO was initiated 96 h postinitiation of mechanical ventilation. At the time of cannulation, his arterial PaO2 to FiO2 (P/F) ratio was 45. He was treated with tocilizumab on April 11, and the following day, an additional unit of convalescent plasma was given. Neither he did receive remdesivir, nor did he receive steroids. Systemic heparin for the ECMO circuit was used with a target partial thromboplastin time of 40–60 s. A lung-protective strategy was employed using an airway pressure release ventilation mode that was frequently adjusted to minimize airway pressures and atelectasis.\n",

      "A 79-year-old African American female presented to the emergency room for shortness of breath with exertion and grade 2+ bilateral lower limb edema. The patient denied dizziness, palpitation, fever, chills, productive cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, melena, and hematochezia.\n",
      "On examination, the patient's blood pressure was 94/66 mmHg, the temperature was 97.6 °F, the heart rate was irregular with a rate of 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and she was saturating 100% on room air. Sinus pauses were noted, up to 10 seconds in length, on the telemetry monitor. ECG and telemetry monitoring demonstrated SSS with sinus bradycardia, pauses up to three seconds, and atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rate of 130 beats per minute (bpm; Figure ). Her other medical history included paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, lower extremity venous insufficiency, diastolic heart failure (ejection fraction of 70-75%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, and no other medical history reported. The patient's home medications included fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhaler, albuterol sulfate inhaler, torsemide, metolazone, potassium chloride, vitamin D3, pantoprazole, sotalol, and no other heart rate modulating medication reported. Laboratory workup revealed a potassium of 4.5 (3.5-5.1 mM/L), magnesium of 2.3 (1.7-2.7 mg/dL), thyroid-stimulating hormone of 1.54 (0.34-5.60 µIU/mL), and troponin of 0.1 (0.0-0.5 ng/mL). The patient underwent urgent pacemaker placement to prevent further sinus pauses.\n",
      "The patient was also complaining of dysphagia and difficulty swallowing, for which an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed. The procedure identified both esophageal and duodenal ulcers. The biopsy was performed during the EGD and sent for histopathological review. The esophagus contained small columnar pieces of mucosa and collections of eosinophilic, amorphous material demonstrated on congo red staining. The congo red stain contained one fragment with blood vessels that exhibited mural deposition of amyloid. In the duodenal biopsy, the lamina propria also had amyloid on congo red staining. Videofluoroscopic swallowing examination revealed no tracheal aspiration and no motility disorder. Eventually, the patient required percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement for feeding secondary to dysphagia. TTE findings were consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy, raising the possibility of cardiomyopathy secondary to amyloidosis and SSS as the initial presenting feature in our patient.\n",
      "The patient had also developed a bifascicular block, which was potentially consistent with an infiltrative amyloid disease. The patient had a Kappa free light chain drawn, and this was markedly elevated at 146 mg/dL (reference range 0.3-1.9 mg/dL), Lambda 1.97 (0.5-2.6 mg/dL), with a Kappa/Lambda ratio of 74.1. We performed electrophoresis to investigate further and found an elevated gamma globulin of 1.75 g/dL (reference range 0.70-1.50 mg/dL).\n",
      "Two months later the patient presented with persistent, progressive shortness of breath on minimal exertion and persistent lower limb edema. Laboratory work-up was significant for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 838 (2-100 pg/mL), BUN of 37, creatinine of 1.85, white blood cell count of 10.3 (4.5-11.0 × 103/µL), hemoglobin of 10.7 (12.0-15.7 g/dl), and platelet count of 178 (140-440 × 103/µL). ECG was obtained and demonstrated an atrial paced rhythm, bifascicular block, left anterior fascicular block, right bundle branch block, and a pronounced low voltage pattern throughout all leads (Figure ). She had three negative troponins, and her pacemaker was found to be functioning appropriately. The patient did not have any compelling cardiac symptoms aside from the dyspnea on exertion.\n",

      "A renal biopsy and bone marrow biopsy were performed to confirm the diagnosis of amyloidosis. The results of these biopsies were consistent with our hypothesis that the patient had AL amyloid.

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 38-year-old G2P2 African American woman presented with 3-hour duration of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Her pain was acute in onset and constant in nature, radiated to both groins, and was progressively worsening. She denied any musculoskeletal pain. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension, fibroid uterus, and a cholecystectomy. She had worsening menorrhagia over the past two months. Her last gynecologic evaluation was three years prior to presentation. She reported tobacco use and denied alcohol or drug consumption. Physical examination revealed diffuse rebound tenderness and a palpable abdominal mass. Initial vital signs were as follows: temperature of 38.6°C, heart rate of 122 beats per minute, blood pressure of 48/37, and respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 88% and increased to 94% on 2 liters of nasal oxygen.\n",
      "Biochemical testing showed an elevated white blood cell count (13.5 K/μL), significant neutrophilia (94.8%), an elevatedcreatinine (3.8 mg/dL), low hemoglobin (8.9 g/dL), low potassium (3.2 mEq/L), and an elevated myoglobin (2140 ng/mL, normal range: 0–101 ng/mL). A cardiac and skeletal muscle enzyme panel was normal. Baseline creatinine from a prior admission was normal (0.6 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed trace blood and amorphous sediment. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed a 24 cm × 13 cm × 13 cm complex mass occupying the pelvis and extending to the upper abdomen (). Both kidneys appeared normal in size without perinephric inflammation, hydronephrosis, or hydroureter. Renal sonography revealed normal echotexture and ureteral caliber.\n",
      "The working diagnosis was acute septic shock with associated acute renal failure. The patient had nonanion gap metabolic acidosis with a lactic acid level of 4.5 mmol/L (normal 0.4–2 mmol/L) and a pH of 7.40 with a compensatory decrease in PCO secondary to hyperventilation. Blood and urine cultures were obtained and the patient was started on intravenous fluid resuscitation, a bicarbonate drip, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. A norepinephrine infusion was used to maintain a normotensive state. The pelvic mass was thought to be the source of the patient's abdominal pain and represented a degenerating fibroid that was contributing to her critical presentation with worsening inflammation and myoglobinemia. Relevant tumor markers including CEA, AFP, CA-125, and inhibins A and B were normal.\n",
      "The patient's overall status continued to worsen the following day. She became obtunded with loss of consciousness, in sinus tachycardia, and hypotensive despite all aforementioned measures. Endotracheal intubation then followed. Furthermore, her renal function continued to deteriorate (creatinine of 7 mg/dL). Urine and blood cultures had still not yielded any bacterial growth. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated and the decision to perform an exploratory laparotomy and remove the pelvic mass followed, as it was attributed to the patient's worsening critical state.\n",
      "A large solitary fibroid was found within the left broad ligament that was densely adherent and contiguous with the uterus. The uterus and adnexal structures appeared significantly devitalized and edematous and were displacing the ureters without evidence of hydroureter. The bowels appeared normal. A total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed with an estimated blood loss of 150 mL. The patient remained intubated and returned to the surgical intensive care unit. The postoperative period was complicated by atrial fibrillation that responded to intravenous amiodarone in addition to anemia (Hg 6.7 g/dL) requiring blood transfusion.\n",
      "Dramatic biochemical improvement occurred over the next 48 hours with CRRT following surgery. Final blood and urine cultures were negative at 48 hours. Serum creatinine decreased to 1.4 mg/dL but however rebounded slowly over the following three days and peaked at 3.1 mg/dL. Serum myoglobin reached a nadir of 380.4 ng/mL by the fourth postoperative day (POD) and steadily increased and reached a plateau of 1074 ng/mL by POD-8 (). Clinical improvement followed with defervescence and normalization of vital signs by POD-3 and POD-5, respectively. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were discontinued at this time. The patient had normal sinus rhythm, was normotensive without any vasopressors, and was extubated uneventfully. The pathology reported a 29.4 × 20.8 × 19.7 cm large solitary leiomyoma weighing 3028 grams and showing extensive loss of nuclei from cells, stromal hyalinization, polymorphonuclear white blood cell infiltrate, and foci of calcifications reflecting various stages of early and late fibroid degenerative changes (). Both adnexal structures showed an extensive infiltrate of polymorphonuclear cells suggestive of severe and acute inflammation.\n",
      "The patient was discharged on POD-8 in a stable condition. Serum creatinine remained stable at 2.9 mg/dL, and myoglobin was 1074 ng/mL. She showed complete biochemical and clinical remission by her 4-week follow-up with a return to baseline serum creatinine (0.6 mg/dL) and a normal serum myoglobin of 25 ng/mL ().

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 48-year-old diabetic male was referred to us with a diagnosis of basal VSR, approximately 2 weeks before MI. He had a history of breathlessness of New York Heart Association class III with bilateral pedal edema and oliguria for the past 15 days. On admission, he was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and heart rate of 110/min. He had elevated cardiac markers (troponin I of 0.1 ng/mL) with electrocardiogram showing Q waves in leads II, III avf showing evolved inferior wall (IW) and right ventricle (RV) MI. A two-dimensional echocardiography showed hypokinetic basal septum and a huge VSR [] of 18 × 20 mm in size shunting left to right [] with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (RV systolic pressure of 75 mmHg) and biventricular dysfunction and mild mitral regurgitation (MR) with an RV wall motion index (WMI) of 0.8. An elective coronary angiogram showed proximal tight occlusions of both the right coronary artery (RCA) and the obtuse marginal (OM) branch of the left circumflex. The left anterior descending artery was normal. He was planned for surgical closure of the VSR with grafts to OM and RCA territories after a week's time.\n",
      "A Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted after induction showing a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 24 mmHg, a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and diastolic pressure (DP) of 60 and 33 mmHg, respectively, and a diastolic pulmonary gradient of 9 mmHg. The central venous pressure (CVP) was 15 mmHg. Simultaneous right atrial and pulmonary artery saturations showed a step up of 30%. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was instituted with aorto bicaval cannulation and the heart was arrested by Del Nido cardioplegia (aortic root). After adequate retraction, a vertical left ventriculotomy was done parallel to the posterior descending artery (PDA) in the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. The VSR was visualized with difficulty by retracting the papillary muscle [] and its chordae tendinae. It was closed with bovine pericardium with interrupted 2-0 polypropylene sutures using David technique. The left ventriculotomy was closed [] followed by OM and PDA grafting as planned. After adequate period of CPB support with an aortic cross clamp time of 88 min and CPB time of 145 min, the patient was weaned off CPB. Transesophageal echo showed intact VSR patch with biventricular dysfunction. During closure, arterial pressures were 100/60 mmHg with a PASP of 45 and DP of 23 mmHg. The patient was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with supports of inj. dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min, inj. adrenaline 0.08 μg/kg/min, and inj. vasopressin 2 IU/h. As the cardiac contractility was reasonably alright, IABP was not inserted in the operation theater with a low threshold of insertion in case of eventuality.\n",
      "The patient was shifted to the ICU with continuous monitoring with cardiac output (CO) of 3.5 L/min and cardiac index (CI) of 1.9 L/min/m2 and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) of 1900 dynes-s/cm5. After 6 h, there was a drop in CO and SVR elevation, and hence a 40-cc IABP was inserted percutaneously through the right common femoral artery (CFA). The patient's hemodynamics improved and he was extubated on the second postoperative day (POD). As he was hemodynamically stable, on the fourth POD, IABP was removed with inj. dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min and inj. adrenaline 0.05 μg/kg/min. Six hours later, there was once again a drop in the CI and CO and echo showed severe RV dysfunction with a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) value of 8 mm. Inotropes were hiked with no further improvement. Twelve hours later, the patient became dyspneic, tachypneic with a mixed venous oxygen saturation (MVO2) of 35%, and a pulmonary vascular resistance of 250 dynes-s/cm5 and was electively re-intubated in view of hypoxia due to low cardiac output. A sheathless 34-cc IABP was re-inserted percutaneously through the left CFA. The hemodynamics improved and MVO2 improved to 70%. He was extubated the next day and a decision was made to retain the IABP. The IABP was removed after 10 days (1:1 augmentation for 8 days and 1:2 for the next 48 h and 1:3 for the next 24 h) and inotropes were reduced. Repeat echo showed improvement in the RV function with a TAPSE improving to 12 mm. He was discharged in a stable condition on 18th POD. Discharge echo revealed intact VSR patch [] with moderate biventricular dysfunctionand TAPSE value of 12 mm and moderate MR [].

      "A 63-year-old Caucasian male with a history only significant for daily marijuana use received the J&J COVID-19 vaccine on May 7, 2021. One day later, he developed intractable nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, watery diarrhea, chills, sweats, and heavy chest pain. In the emergency department (ED), the patient was tachycardic at 120 beats per minute, hypoxic with oxygen 88% on room air, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) 3421 pg/ml, elevated troponins at 1.29 ng/ml, procalcitonin 25 ng/ml, lactic acid 5.0 mmol/L, white blood cells 19 K/UL, thrombocytopenia at 101 K/UL, and creatinine 1.91 mg/dL. Initial chest X-ray showed bilateral airspace opacities consistent with atypical pneumonia. The patient was intubated because he was in severe respiratory distress with use of accessory muscles and decreased oxygen saturation. Ventilator settings are presented in Table .\n",
      "Echo showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 25% with global hypokinesis and grade 3 diastolic dysfunction. A right heart catheterization was performed, showing severe pulmonary hypertension. An intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted, but his condition continued to decline, so a left-sided Impella device (Impella Cardiosystems AG, Aachen, Germany) was placed and milrinone and norepinephrine were started.\n",
      "The patient was worked up for infectious causes and all were negative including two negative COVID-19 results, viral panel, blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum cultures, and urine legionella. A chest X-ray five days after presenting to the ED is shown below (Figure ).\n",
      "Throughout his nine-day hospital stay, he continued to have rapid cyclical fluctuations of hypertension (260s/130s) and hypotension (40s/20s), persistent fevers up to 40.2 °C, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like picture. His other problems included acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from an acute kidney injury (AKI), hypernatremia, arterial catheter-associated thrombosis in mid left radial artery leading to gangrene of left 1st and 2nd digits, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with cardiogenic shock (on May 10, 2021, EF was 55% with no diastolic dysfunction), subclinical hyperthyroidism, and electroencephalogram (EEG) showed diffuse slowing, with no epileptiform activity. Echo on May 15, 2021 showed EF of 43% with mild global hypokinesis.\n",
      "Neuroendocrine crisis was suspected, and the patient was worked up for pheochromocytoma and carcinoid syndrome (Table ).\n",
      "The results of retroperitoneal ultrasound are shown below (Figures -).\n",
      "The first step in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is to discontinue medications that may interfere with metanephrine levels such as norepinephrine. Due to our patient's labile blood pressure measurements, he was on and off of vasopressors (such as norepinephrine) and anti-hypertensive medications (nitroglycerin). The results of significantly elevated 24-hour urine fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines or elevated fractionated plasma metanephrines confirms the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Imaging with CT or MRI is done to localize the tumor. Our patient was not stable enough for these imaging tests and thus we had to do an ultrasound. There were no previous imaging studies on record for this patient or a family history that could explain the etiology of his tumor.\n",
      "The patient was transferred to the University of Michigan (U of M) hospital for mass resection on May 21, 2021. A CT was performed that day to confirm the ultrasound finding of a 7 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass. The patient continued to suffer from acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and a tracheostomy was performed on June 07, 2021 due to prolonged intubation. His stay at U of M hospital was also complicated by episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) that responded well to synchronized cardioversion. He was also placed on amiodarone. On June 18, 2021, an open right adrenalectomy was performed and on June 22, 2021, repeat plasma metanephrine was <0.2 nmol/L, and normetanephrine was 0.9 nmol/L. An echo performed on June 22, 2021 revealed a left ventricular EF of 63%, normal overall left ventricular systolic function, normal overall right ventricular systolic function, and no significant valvular dysfunction. Multiple upper and lower extremity deep vein thromboses (DVTs) were found on June 24, 2021. The patient was treated with blood thinners and stabilized for transfer to inpatient rehabilitation on July 02, 2021. The patient was then discharged on July 12, 2021 to stay with his sister. He has continued outpatient therapy and is now able to walk on his own and perform all of his activities of daily living independently.

      "The subject of this report is a 29 year old male, US citizen of Palestinian descent, who works full-time as a biomedical research technician. His health history is unremarkable, except for the fact that at age 16 he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Since then, he has been treated successfully with mesalamine (1.2 g, 2 times per day), azathioprine (50 mg, 3 times per day), and ursidiol (300 mg, 2 times per day). The subject has been able to live an active lifestyle and participate in a variety of sports including running, weightlifting, basketball, and baseball. The subject denies any history of smoking or use of alcohol, opioids, or illicit drugs. On April 22, 2020, the subject's father, who lives in the same house as the subject, and works for a major shipping company, was diagnosed with COVID-19. This was about 2 months after the first case of COVID had been confirmed in his state of residence, which was one of the early active zones of COVID-19 transmission in the US. On April 25, the patient began to experience general malaise and fatigue. Over the next 24 h, the symptoms worsened to include severe fatigue and weakness, loss of appetite, tiredness, slight dry cough, body aches, muscle pain, loss of taste and smell, sore throat and fever. The patient was then seen by his general practice physician. Vital signs at the time of examination were BP 110/72, pulse 97 BPM, respiration 14 per minute, oxygen saturation 98%, and body temperature 101.7°F. The patient was given a naso-pharyngeal swab, real-time RT-PCR test [COBAS (R) SARS-COV-@ test, Labcorp Laboratories, South Bend, IN] that confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19. In compliance with standard medical practice standards, the patient was ordered to self-isolate and to start a 5-day course of azithromycin (250 mg, daily), and to also take 1 g of paracetamol (acetaminophen) every 6 h for treatment of pain and fever. Despite good adherence to the recommended treatment, the symptoms other than fever, did not improve, and he also started to feel depressed, demotivated, and spend long periods in bed. During this period, the patient experienced ongoing generalized myalgia and musculoskeletal pain. He described the pain as persistent and relatively severe (rated 7 on a scale of 1–10). Because of this discomfort, after 4 days the patient decided to consume kratom to relieve his symptoms. According to the patient, he had first used kratom 14 months earlier before his COVID-19 infection. He used kratom sporadically (no more than 4–5 times in total) as a cognitive enhancer and not to self-treat pain.\n",
      "The patient decided to take 2.5 gms (or grams) of green kratom (as ground leaf powder suspended in water). The product was purchased at a local shop in April 2020 sold under the name “Green Bali.” After 30 min, he noticed a significant improvement in the intensity of the physical symptoms (mainly pain and fatigue), and within 60 min he felt a sensation of mild euphoria and well-being that lasted for about 5 h. After 6 h following consumption the effects of kratom wore off, and the patient administered another dose. He used kratom three times a day continuously for 3 days (for a total of 9 doses of 2.75 g each) with significant benefit.\n",
      "When asked to score from 0 to 100% the improvement that kratom had on COVID-19 symptoms: fatigue and weakness (80% improvement), tiredness (70% improvement), body aches (80% improvement), muscle pain (90% improvement, “much better than paracetamol/acetaminophen”). The kratom did not seem to have an impact on: fever, cough, or sore throat. The patient also stated: “I didn't have anxiety or any psychological symptoms. For me, kratom mainly gave improvement in physical reaction.” “It also elevated my mood and made me feel less miserable, to the point where I was able to get out of bed, shower, look at work emails without feeling completely exhausted and drained”; “Kratom helped me more than antibiotic”; “I slept better, I essentially fell asleep immediately. Without kratom, sleep was not nice, with kratom less wake ups, about 6 h.” Over the next 2 weeks the patient's symptoms gradually subsided and on May 13 he had a televisit with his physician and a follow-up swab test that was negative for COVID-19. The subject was able to end his quarantine and return to work in early June. In a follow-up interview with us, the patient reported that he did not experience any side effects from using kratom, except for a very bad taste when swallowing it. The patient was also able to discontinue kratom use immediately without any evidence of physical or psychological withdrawal symptoms. The patient also informed us that he still had some of the kratom product that he had taken and he agreed to provide us with a sample for chemical analysis.\n",
      "An established quantitative liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method was conducted () and found that the sample obtained from the patient is kratom due to the presence of mitragynine (102 mg/g kratom powder) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (0.8 mg/g kratom powder). The extracted kratom sample was analyzed for the presence of 13 opioids and 8 benzodiazepines by comparing the chromatograms to those of the reference mixtures Pain Management Multi-component Opiate Mixture-13 solution and Benzodiazepine Multi-component Mixture-8 solution. These data suggest the sample was not fortified with 7-hydroxymitragynine and there was also no evidence of adulteration with opioids or common benzodiazepines in the sample.\n",

For me, kratom mainly gave improvement in physical reaction.” “It also elevated my mood and made me feel less miserable, to the point where I was able to get out of bed, shower, look at work emails without feeling completely exhausted and drained”; “Kratom helped me more than antibiotic”; “I slept better, I essentially fell asleep immediately. Without kratom, sleep was not nice, with kratom less wake ups, about 6 h.” Over the next 2 weeks the patient's symptoms gradually subsided and on May 13 he had a televisit with his physician and a follow-up swab test that was negative for COVID-19. The subject was able to end his quarantine and return to work in early June. In a follow-up interview with us, the patient reported that he did not experience any side effects from using kratom, except for a very bad taste when swallowing it. The patient was also able to discontinue kratom use immediately without any evidence of physical or psychological withdrawal symptoms. The patient also informed us that he still had some of the kratom product that he had taken and he agreed to provide us with a sample for chemical analysis.\n",
      "An established quantitative liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method was conducted () and found that the sample obtained from the patient is kratom due to the presence of mitragynine (102 mg/g kratom powder) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (0.8 mg/g kratom powder). The extracted kratom sample was analyzed for the presence of 13 opioids and 8 benzodiazepines by comparing the chromatograms to those of the reference mixtures Pain Management Multi-component Opiate Mixture-13 solution and Benzodiazepine Multi-component Mixture-8 solution. These data suggest the sample was not fortified with 7-hydroxymitragynine and there was also no evidence of adulteration with opioids or common benzodiazepines in the sample.\n",

      "A 69-year-old Caucasian woman presented to outside hospital with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. Chest pain started approximately a week ago and lasted for about 5 days but then subsided for a day. Next day, the patient was experiencing continuous chest tightness both on right and left side. She was also having dyspnea on exertion. The patient had a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and severe degenerative joint disease. Past surgical history was significant for hysterectomy. She denied any history of smoking cigarettes or using illicit drugs. The patient had a history of occasional alcohol intake. Medications at home included amlodipine/benazepril 10/20 mg daily, raloxifene 60 mg daily, celecoxib 200 mg BID, clonazepam 1 mg daily, fenofibrate 145 mg daily, a multivitamin tablet daily, a calcium tablet 600 mg daily, glucosamine 1500 mg daily, tramadol/acetaminophen 37.5/325 mg BID, and hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10/300 mg as needed for pain.\n",
      "On arrival to the emergency department, the patient was tachycardic with a heart rate of 114/min, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24/min. She was normotensive at that time. Within the next few minutes, the patient became significantly hypotensive. Vitals at that time were blood pressure 78/52, heart rate 109/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and saturation of 96% on 3 L of oxygen via nasal cannula. On physical examination, the patient appeared to be in acute distress. On cardiovascular assessment, S1 and S2 were audible with no added murmur or gallop. She had bilateral pitting lower extremity edema. On lung examination, the patient had bilateral rhonchi and increased respiratory effort.\n",
      "EKG showed sinus tachycardia with q waves and ST segment elevations of almost 2 mm in leads III and aVF. There was also left atrial enlargement (). Radiograph of chest showed interstitial edema. Laboratory results from admission included a basal metabolic panel that showed blood urea nitrogen of 40 mg/dL (6–20 mg/dL), creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL (0.7–1.2 mg/dL), and potassium of 4.2 mEq/L (3.5–5.0 mEq/L). First set of troponin levels were found to be 1.60 ng/mL (0.0–0.3 ng/mL) and first set of CK was 118 U/L (29–200 U/L). A Doppler echocardiogram was done in the emergency room, which showed normal ejection fraction of 60–65% with RV hypokinesis, which was consistent with RVI.\n",
      "The patient was started on vasopressors and emergently transferred to our facility to undergo cardiac catheterization. Left heart catheterization revealed 99% stenosis to mid-right coronary artery and subsequently the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the right coronary artery. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed during cardiac catheterization as the patient was in cardiogenic shock. After successful PCI, the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed as her vitals seemed to have stabilized. Two days later, again the patient developed hypotension and worsening shortness of breath. Urgent bedside Doppler echocardiogram showed a new left-to-right shunt in the ventricle, which was noted to be a muscular VSD. The patient was transferred to a tertiary care medical center for surgical repair. At the tertiary care hospital, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was done, which revealed large VSD with a dimension of 1.38×0.9 cm2 and an area of 0.9 cm2 located in the posterior wall of ventricle ().

After placement of the amplatzer VSD device, significant reduction in left-to-right shunt was noted on TEE. Also, hemodynamically the patient improved and her hypotension resolved, so the intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued.

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 69-year-old Caucasian woman presented to outside hospital with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. Chest pain started approximately a week ago and lasted for about 5 days but then subsided for a day. Next day, the patient was experiencing continuous chest tightness both on right and left side. She was also having dyspnea on exertion. The patient had a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and severe degenerative joint disease. Past surgical history was significant for hysterectomy. She denied any history of smoking cigarettes or using illicit drugs. The patient had a history of occasional alcohol intake. Medications at home included amlodipine/benazepril 10/20 mg daily, raloxifene 60 mg daily, celecoxib 200 mg BID, clonazepam 1 mg daily, fenofibrate 145 mg daily, a multivitamin tablet daily, a calcium tablet 600 mg daily, glucosamine 1500 mg daily, tramadol/acetaminophen 37.5/325 mg BID, and hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10/300 mg as needed for pain.\n",
      "On arrival to the emergency department, the patient was tachycardic with a heart rate of 114/min, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24/min. She was normotensive at that time. Within the next few minutes, the patient became significantly hypotensive. Vitals at that time were blood pressure 78/52, heart rate 109/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and saturation of 96% on 3 L of oxygen via nasal cannula. On physical examination, the patient appeared to be in acute distress. On cardiovascular assessment, S1 and S2 were audible with no added murmur or gallop. She had bilateral pitting lower extremity edema. On lung examination, the patient had bilateral rhonchi and increased respiratory effort.\n",
      "EKG showed sinus tachycardia with q waves and ST segment elevations of almost 2 mm in leads III and aVF. There was also left atrial enlargement (). Radiograph of chest showed interstitial edema. Laboratory results from admission included a basal metabolic panel that showed blood urea nitrogen of 40 mg/dL (6–20 mg/dL), creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL (0.7–1.2 mg/dL), and potassium of 4.2 mEq/L (3.5–5.0 mEq/L). First set of troponin levels were found to be 1.60 ng/mL (0.0–0.3 ng/mL) and first set of CK was 118 U/L (29–200 U/L). A Doppler echocardiogram was done in the emergency room, which showed normal ejection fraction of 60–65% with RV hypokinesis, which was consistent with RVI.\n",
      "The patient was started on vasopressors and emergently transferred to our facility to undergo cardiac catheterization. Left heart catheterization revealed 99% stenosis to mid-right coronary artery and subsequently the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the right coronary artery. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed during cardiac catheterization as the patient was in cardiogenic shock. After successful PCI, the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed as her vitals seemed to have stabilized. Two days later, again the patient developed hypotension and worsening shortness of breath. Urgent bedside Doppler echocardiogram showed a new left-to-right shunt in the ventricle, which was noted to be a muscular VSD. The patient was transferred to a tertiary care medical center for surgical repair. At the tertiary care hospital, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was done, which revealed large VSD with a dimension of 1.38×0.9 cm2 and an area of 0.9 cm2 located in the posterior wall of ventricle (). TEE also showed mildly reduced RV systolic function and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation ( and ).\n",
      "The patient subsequently developed S. aureus bacteremia and Clostridium difficile colitis, which were successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics. She underwent cardiothoracic surgery for possible surgical versus percutaneous repair of the VSD. Based on the location of the VSD, the patient was considered to be an excellent candidate for percutaneous repair with amplatzer postinfarct VSD occluder device. After placement of the amplatzer VSD device, significant reduction in left-to-right shunt was noted on TEE. Also, hemodynamically the patient improved and her hypotension resolved, so the intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued. Eventually, the patient developed sepsis secondary to C. difficile colitis, which resulted in development of disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemodynamic collapse, and death.\n",

      "1. **Age < 50 years**: The patient is 69 years old, which is greater than 50. Therefore, this criterion is not met (false).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Heart rate < 100 beats per minute**: The patient's heart rate is mentioned as 114/min initially and later as 109/min, both of which are greater than 100 beats per minute. Thus, this criterion is not met (false).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Oxygen saturation ≥ 95%**: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% on 3 L of oxygen via nasal cannula, which meets this criterion (true).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **No unilateral leg swelling**: The patient has bilateral pitting lower extremity edema, which means there is leg swelling, but it is not unilateral. However, the presence of any leg swelling could be considered a risk factor, but since it's bilateral and not explicitly unilateral, we might interpret this as not meeting the criterion for unilateral swelling, yet in the context of PERC, bilateral swelling does not directly negate the criterion of \"no unilateral leg swelling\" as it specifically asks for unilateral. Therefore, based on strict interpretation, this could be considered true because it does not specify unilateral swelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **No hemoptysis**: There is no mention of hemoptysis in the patient note, so we assume this criterion is met (true).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **No recent trauma or surgery**: The patient has a history of recent surgery (hysterectomy) mentioned, but it is not recent in the context provided. However, the patient did undergo recent cardiac catheterization and PCI, which could be considered a form of surgery. Given the context, it seems there was a recent invasive procedure, so this criterion might not be met (false), but considering the hysterectomy is not recent and the context of \"recent\" is often considered in the timeframe of weeks for such criteria, and the recent procedures were diagnostic and therapeutic for the current condition, the interpretation might lean towards this being about trauma or major surgery directly preceding the presentation, which is not clearly the case here. Thus, this could be considered true if focusing strictly on the \"recent\" aspect and the nature of the procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **No history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)**: There is no mention of a history of DVT or PE in the patient note, so we assume this criterion is met (true).\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **No hormone (estrogen) use**: The patient is taking raloxifene, which is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), used in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and also has some estrogen-like effects. However, the criterion specifically mentions \"hormone (estrogen) use,\" which typically refers to estrogen therapy. Raloxifene's mechanism is more complex, and while it has estrogen-like effects on some tissues, it is not the same as estrogen therapy. Given the strict interpretation of the criterion, one might argue this does not directly apply, but considering the spirit of the criterion (use of hormones that could increase thromboembolic risk), raloxifene could potentially be considered. However, based on the precise wording, this could be interpreted as true because it's not traditional estrogen use.\n",

      "A 52-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department complaining of pleuritic, sharp pain in his right chest wall that had begun three days prior to arrival. The pain had since worsened in intensity, and did not radiate. He had taken acetaminophen without relief of his symptoms. The patient denied any fever, cough, shortness of breath, headache, or rash. His review of symptoms was otherwise negative. The patient had no significant past medical history and was taking no medications. He denied any recent history of surgery or trauma, but did note weight lifting two days prior to the onset of symptoms. Family history was negative for coagulopathies and autoimmune conditions.\n",

Lung sounds were clear bilaterally and heart sounds were normal. A raised cord was visible crossing from the epigastrium across the right breast toward the axilla, that was tender to palpation and mobile. There was no warmth, erythema, or rash overlying the cord. Head/eyes/ears/nose/throat, abdominal, and neurological examinations were unremarkable.\n",

Chest radiograph showed clear lung fields but did reveal remote right-sided posterior fractures of ribs five through eight. Given the pleuritic nature of the pain, a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram was ordered to rule out pulmonary embolism. As shown in Figure , it revealed a subtle density in the right chest wall over the area of the palpable cord, with no evidence of a pulmonary embolism. The diagnosis of superficial chest wall thrombophlebitis, or Mondor’s disease, was made.\n",

      "To calculate the PERC score for this patient, we will evaluate each of the 8 criteria based on the information provided in the patient note.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Age < 50 years**: The patient is 69 years old, which is greater than 50. Therefore, this criterion is not met (false).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Heart rate < 100 beats per minute**: The patient's heart rate is mentioned as 114/min initially and later as 109/min, both of which are greater than 100 beats per minute. Thus, this criterion is not met (false).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Oxygen saturation ≥ 95%**: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% on 3 L of oxygen via nasal cannula, which meets this criterion (true).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **No unilateral leg swelling**: The patient has bilateral pitting lower extremity edema, which means there is leg swelling, but it is not unilateral. However, the presence of any leg swelling could be considered a risk factor, but since it's bilateral and not explicitly unilateral, we might interpret this as not meeting the criterion for unilateral swelling, yet in the context of PERC, bilateral swelling does not directly negate the criterion of \"no unilateral leg swelling\" as it specifically asks for unilateral. Therefore, based on strict interpretation, this could be considered true because it does not specify unilateral swelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **No hemoptysis**: There is no mention of hemoptysis in the patient note, so we assume this criterion is met (true).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **No recent trauma or surgery**: The patient has a history of recent surgery (hysterectomy) mentioned, but it is not recent in the context provided. However, the patient did undergo recent cardiac catheterization and PCI, which could be considered a form of surgery. Given the context, it seems there was a recent invasive procedure, so this criterion might not be met (false), but considering the hysterectomy is not recent and the context of \"recent\" is often considered in the timeframe of weeks for such criteria, and the recent procedures were diagnostic and therapeutic for the current condition, the interpretation might lean towards this being about trauma or major surgery directly preceding the presentation, which is not clearly the case here. Thus, this could be considered true if focusing strictly on the \"recent\" aspect and the nature of the procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **No history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)**: There is no mention of a history of DVT or PE in the patient note, so we assume this criterion is met (true).\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **No hormone (estrogen) use**: The patient is taking raloxifene, which is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), used in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and also has some estrogen-like effects. However, the criterion specifically mentions \"hormone (estrogen) use,\" which typically refers to estrogen therapy. Raloxifene's mechanism is more complex, and while it has estrogen-like effects on some tissues, it is not the same as estrogen therapy. Given the strict interpretation of the criterion, one might argue this does not directly apply, but considering the spirit of the criterion (use of hormones that could increase thromboembolic risk), raloxifene could potentially be considered. However, based on the precise wording, this could be interpreted as true because it's not traditional estrogen use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Age < 50**: false\n",

      "- **O₂ ≥ 95%**: true\n",
      "- **No hemoptysis**: true\n",
