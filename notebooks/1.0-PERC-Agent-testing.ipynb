      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 73-year-old female was brought by emergency medical services (EMS) to the emergency department (ED) after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). She was driving when her car crashed into a streetlamp at 40 miles per hour. The EMS team reported that the pole intruded into the passenger compartment and the patient required a prolonged extrication. She had a Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) of 11 when EMS arrived at the scene, which improved to a 15 after repeated evaluations. She was conscious, alert, and oriented at the scene and during transport.\n",
      "The patient had difficulty recalling the events before the collision. She remembered feeling “like I was having a panic attack” just before the crash, and she did not recall the car impacting the streetlamp. In the ED, she complained of substernal chest pressure. The patient’s history was limited due to her continued difficulty recalling the events of the accident. The patient’s son was contacted and he stated that she lives alone and is active and independent. He stated that she had experienced syncopal episodes over the last several years, all associated with paroxysms of panic when driving, and she had undergone extensive workups without any clear etiology identified. She had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain with and without contrast four years prior for stroke-like symptoms after a syncopal event. Per his report, no abnormalities were found.\n",
      "The patient had a past medical history of anxiety, migraines, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and hyperlipidemia. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, which was treated with a left mastectomy followed by five years of tamoxifen and letrozole treatment. She had a family history of dementia, diabetes, and heart disease. She denied using tobacco, alcohol, or illicit substances. She was prescribed, and was taking, the following medications: levothyroxine 25 micrograms daily; atorvastatin 20 milligrams (mg) nightly; rizatriptan 10 mg as needed for headaches; and multivitamins.\n",
      "On physical exam, the patient’s temperature was 36.5° Celsius, her heart rate was 92 beats per minute, and her blood pressure was 142/72 millimeters of mercury. She was breathing at a rate of 21 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She weighed 125 pounds and was 5 feet, 3 inches tall, with a body mass index of 22.1 kilograms per meter squared. She did not appear to be in any acute distress, was healthy appearing, and was oriented to her name, date, and location. Her head was normocephalic and atraumatic; she had no Battle sign, raccoon eyes, or other signs of trauma. She had hearing aids in place bilaterally. She had normal extraocular movements with equal pupils that were reactive to light. She had a cervical collar in place.

      "A 73-year-old female was brought by emergency medical services (EMS) to the emergency department (ED) after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). She was driving when her car crashed into a streetlamp at 40 miles per hour. The EMS team reported that the pole intruded into the passenger compartment and the patient required a prolonged extrication. She had a Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) of 11 when EMS arrived at the scene, which improved to a 15 after repeated evaluations. She was conscious, alert, and oriented at the scene and during transport.\n",
      "The patient had difficulty recalling the events before the collision. She remembered feeling “like I was having a panic attack” just before the crash, and she did not recall the car impacting the streetlamp. In the ED, she complained of substernal chest pressure. The patient’s history was limited due to her continued difficulty recalling the events of the accident. The patient’s son was contacted and he stated that she lives alone and is active and independent. He stated that she had experienced syncopal episodes over the last several years, all associated with paroxysms of panic when driving, and she had undergone extensive workups without any clear etiology identified. She had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain with and without contrast four years prior for stroke-like symptoms after a syncopal event. Per his report, no abnormalities were found.\n",
      "The patient had a past medical history of anxiety, migraines, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and hyperlipidemia. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, which was treated with a left mastectomy followed by five years of tamoxifen and letrozole treatment. She had a family history of dementia, diabetes, and heart disease. She denied using tobacco, alcohol, or illicit substances. She was prescribed, and was taking, the following medications: levothyroxine 25 micrograms daily; atorvastatin 20 milligrams (mg) nightly; rizatriptan 10 mg as needed for headaches; and multivitamins.\n",
      "On physical exam, the patient’s temperature was 36.5° Celsius, her heart rate was 92 beats per minute, and her blood pressure was 142/72 millimeters of mercury. She was breathing at a rate of 21 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She weighed 125 pounds and was 5 feet, 3 inches tall, with a body mass index of 22.1 kilograms per meter squared. She did not appear to be in any acute distress, was healthy appearing, and was oriented to her name, date, and location. Her head was normocephalic and atraumatic; she had no Battle sign, raccoon eyes, or other signs of trauma. She had hearing aids in place bilaterally. She had normal extraocular movements with equal pupils that were reactive to light. She had a cervical collar in place. Later, when it was safe to remove her collar, her neck had a normal range of motion without rigidity or pain.\n",

      "A 66-year-old man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia was brought to the ED for altered mental status. The patient’s wife reported that two hours prior to arrival, he had ingested two glasses of wine and took a nap. Prior to napping the wife noted no unusual symptoms. Upon awaking, he was noted to have dysarthria and discoordination of his extremities and was brought to the ED. His wife reported that his home medications included bupropion, dutasteride, lisinopril, and tolterodine.\n",
      "His vital signs were blood pressure 115/78 millimeters mercury, heart rate 83 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, temperature 36.8° Celsius, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. On exam, the patient was noted to have waxing and waning alertness, but he could intermittently answer questions and follow commands. His pupils were reactive, sluggish, and with horizontal and vertical nystagmus. His face was symmetric and his tongue was midline. His speech was dysarthric. He was unable to follow commands for strength testing, but he was moving all extremities without appreciable asymmetry. He had bilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing. He had truncal ataxia in the seated position. His mental status and ataxia progressively worsened during his ED stay of approximately 1.5 hours.\n",
      "Given the acute onset of symptoms, an institutional stroke alert was activated and a head computed tomography angiogram was obtained, which was negative for hemorrhage or other abnormality. Laboratory values, including complete blood count, chemistry panel, coagulation panel, and urinalysis were within normal limits. His blood alcohol level was 57 mg/dL. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with a QRS of 108 ms and a QTc of 497 ms. A dose of naloxone 0.4 milligrams was trialed without improvement in patient’s somnolence. He was evaluated by the neurology consultant team and determined to have a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale of 11. Given concern for a posterior circulation stroke, tissue plasminogen activator was administered for thrombolysis. The patient was subsequently intubated for airway protection due to increasing somnolence and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).\n",
      "While intubated in the ICU, the patient developed status epilepticus, characterized by three periods of generalized tonic clonic activity, each lasting approximately five minutes. He received multiple doses of benzodiazepine and phenytoin, in addition to the propofol infusion for sedation, resulting in cessation of seizure activity. Subsequent electroencephalogram did not demonstrate ongoing seizure activity, and the patient did not have an additional seizure during the hospital course while maintained on phenytoin.\n",
      "Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain did not show evidence of acute stroke. Comprehensive urine drug screen by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry was positive for clozapine and clozapine metabolites, in addition to caffeine and bupropion, a home medication. No drugs of abuse or other medications were detected. However, the patient had never been prescribed clozapine. In discussion with his wife, it was learned that the patient’s family member takes clozapine for a psychiatric condition. The patient manages the family member’s medication and they frequently take their respective medications at the same time. It was concluded that the patient must have mistaken the family member’s medication for his and accidently ingested the family member’s usual dose of 200 mg of clozapine, hours prior to his presentation.

      "A 40-year-old previously healthy man with a past medical history only notable for a body mass index of 27 presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with several days of fever and cough. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nasopharyngeal swab. His vital signs on examination were notable for a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and a temperature of 38.2°C. His chest X-ray was unremarkable. Given his clinical stability, further labwork was deferred and the patient was discharged from the ED to self-quarantine at home. Over the subsequent 3 weeks, the patient’s symptoms completely resolved. He had repeat COVID-19 testing prior to returning to work, which was negative.\n",
      "Two months after his negative COVID-19 testing, the patient developed progressive dyspnoea with minimal exertion. He had an episode of syncope which prompted him to return to the ED for further evaluation. On presentation, his blood pressure was 126/99 mmHg, heart rate 122 beats per minute, temperature 37.5°C, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Physical examination was notable for tachycardia with regular rhythm, 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border, positive jugular venous distention to 10 cm, lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, and no evidence of lower extremity oedema.\n",
      "Labwork was significant for a troponin of 0.12 ng/mL (normal < 0.02 ng/mL), brain natriuretic peptide of 1321 pg/mL (normal < 100 pg/mL), lactate 2.5 mm/l (normal 0.9–1.7 mm/l), and a D-dimer of 19 014 ng/mL fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) (normal < 100 ng/mL FEU). Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with an S1Q3T3 pattern (see ). Given the significantly elevated D-dimer and history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a computed tomography angiogram with PE protocol was obtained that demonstrated acute bilateral PE described as a central obstructive clot with acute thrombus and a high obstructive score as defined by a modified Miller score of 15 (see ). Bedside echocardiography revealed severe right ventricular (RV) enlargement (6.5 cm) (), positive McConnell’s sign, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (), right ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral (RVOT VTI) of 6.69 cm (normal > 10 cm) (), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion of 10 mm (normal > 18 mm) (), and an right ventricular:left ventricular ratio of 2.4 (normal < 1) (). Repeat SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing returned positive, and the patient was admitted to the coronary care unit on a heparin infusion.\n",
      "After a multidisciplinary pulmonary embolism response team discussion, it was recommended that the patient be escalated to catheter-directed thrombolysis given the multiple high-risk features for acute decompensation. Unfortunately, prior to the procedure the patient had an episode of bradycardia and hypoxia followed immediately by cardiopulmonary arrest with pulseless electrical activity (PEA). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately initiated and full-dose systemic alteplase was administered. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for consideration of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

      "An 84-year-old woman presented to our hospital with complaints of a 1-week history of abdominal pain and appetite loss. The patient had no history of cough, sputum, fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. She had no history of tobacco smoking, tuberculosis or exposure to individuals with tuberculosis. She did not have a history of malignancy, diabetes mellitus, cytotoxic therapy or corticosteroid use. Her family history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 90 beats/min, blood pressure of 157/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, temperature of 37.8 °C and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Respiratory, cardiac and abdominal examination were unremarkable. Chest radiograph showed multiple small nodules in both lung fields and chest computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse micronodules in random patterns in both lung lobes, cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusion (Figs. and ). White blood cell count, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were 2800 /μl, 7.50 mg/dl (normal range 0.00–0.10 mg/dl) and 0.373 ng/ml (normal range 0.000–0.046 ng/ml), respectively. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19–9 and soluble IL-2 receptor were elevated at 9.4 ng/ml (normal range 0.0–5.0 ng/ml), 188.4 U/ml (normal range 0.0–37.0 U/ml) and 6163 U/ml (normal range 0–500 U/ml), respectively. Angiotensin-converting enzyme, mycoplasma antibody and blood sugar were within normal ranges. Serum QuantiFERON testing was positive. CD4/8 ratio, CD4 count and CD8 count were 1.73 (normal range 0.6–2.9), 422 /μl (normal range 344–1289) and 244 /μl (normal range 110–1066), respectively. IgG, IgA and IgM were 998 mg/dl (normal range 870–1700), 128 mg/dl (normal range 110–410), 59 mg/dl (normal range 46–260), respectively. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection was negative. Expectorated sputum smears were negative for bacteria and acid-fast bacilli. Urinary antigen testing (Binax NOW; Binax, Inc., Portland, ME) for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila was negative. According to these results, we initially suspected intraabdominal malignancy including malignant lymphoma. However, abdominal CT and magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormalities. Therefore, we suspected miliary tuberculosis or pulmonary sarcoidosis. Liver, skin and bone marrow biopsies were subsequently performed and showed epithelioid cell granuloma without caseous necrosis. Gastric aspirate smear was positive for acid-fast bacilli and polymerase chain reaction (Loopamp; Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although these microbiological findings might indicate the presence of non-viable M. tuberculosis, miliary tuberculosis was suspected and antimycobacterial therapy [oral isoniazid (INH) 200 mg/day, rifampicin (RFP) 300 mg/day and ethambutol (EB) 500 mg/day] was initiated on hospital day 12. Gastric aspirate culture was positive for M. tuberculosis after 1 week of culture. After a 2-month treatment course, chest radiograph showed gradual improvement, oral EB was discontinued and the patient was discharged. Although INH and RFP therapy was continued, chest radiograph showed new multiple nodules in the right middle lung field after a 6-month treatment course. Chest CT showed that a right S6 small nodule, presumed to be miliary tuberculosis, had increased and new multiple nodules appeared in the right lower lobe (Fig. ). The patient’s white blood cell count and C-reactive protein at this time were 2400 /μl and 0.09 mg/dl, respectively. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy was subsequently perfomed. Microbiological testing of bronchial lavage fluids did not reveal any bacteria, mycobacteria or fungi. However, cytology showed a small number of Periodic acid-Schiff-positive bodies, suggesting Cryptococcus species (Fig. ). Moreover, serum cryptococcal antigen testing (Serodirect “EIKEN” Cryptococcus; Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) was positive (×128). According to these findings, pulmonary cryptococcosis was diagnosed, although the culture was negative. Oral fluconazole (FLCZ; 300 mg/day) was subsequently initiated. After a 6-month treatment course, chest radiograph showed gradual improvement and oral FLCZ was discontinued. The patient received a total of 12 months of antimycobacterial therapy. On follow-up, she has remained asymptomatic with suspect to pulmonary disease, with no recurrence.\n",

      "History: A 37-year old female with history of migraine and recent diagnosis of hypertension presented to the ED complaining of chest pressure and dyspnea on exertion for two weeks prior to presentation. She described pressure in the sternal area of her chest, constant, 7/10, radiating to her back, her jaw and her right arm. Patient reported being admitted to a nearby hospital with similar symptoms a month earlier. She had a transient left bundle branch block (LBBB) on her electrocardiogram and was worked up for acute coronary syndrome. Her cardiac biomarkers were negative, and she underwent a stress echocardiogram during which she exercised for 6 minutes on a Bruce protocol, achieving 7.1 metabolic equivalents (METS), and had normal left ventricular chamber size diminution and a normal baseline ejection fraction (~65 percent). Exercise was stopped secondary to fatigue, and the only concerning finding was that she had septal hypokinesis that was read as possible ischemia versus a consequence of her LBBB.\n",
      "On the basis of her abnormal stress echocardiogram she also underwent stress perfusion imaging that showed possible anterior ischemia – again in the setting of her LBBB. On this basis she underwent a coronary angiography at the local hospital that revealed no obstructive coronary disease. She was discharged home, with a diagnosis of non-cardiac chest pain.\n",
      "Over the next week, patient’s symptoms worsened with chest pain radiating down right arm, associated with profound fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, tingling in the jaw. These symptoms disrupted her work as a postal worker and brought her to the second emergency department for evaluation.\n",

      "A 66-year-old Caucasian man with no significant past medical history presented with flu-like symptoms, progressively worsening shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing (NYHA class III) and dry cough over the past 2 weeks prior to presentation. He denied any fever, chills, sputum production, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, anorexia, weight loss, recent or past exposure to tuberculosis, sick contacts, pets, recent travel or past exposure to cigarette smoke (active or passive), asbestos, silica, coal dust or chemicals. He maintained an active lifestyle walking 5 miles three times a week without overt dyspnea. He had no prior history of connective tissue disease or HIV and denied any history of skin rash or joint pains. Past surgical, social and family histories were non-contributory. He also had no history of prior use of any long term medications. He had presented to the hospital 4 days prior to present admission and a provisional diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia was made based on chest radiograph findings and he was discharged home on 2L of oxygen and Levofloxacin, but came back to the hospital due to lack of obvious improvement.\n",
      "On examination, he appeared tired with shortness of breath. The temperature was 99.9°F, the pulse 124/min, respiratory rate 26/min and oxygen saturation of 86% on 2L. Skin was diaphoretic. There was no evidence of rash, pallor, lymphadenopathy, clubbing, joint swelling or edema. Auscultation of chest revealed diminished breath sounds with bilateral velcro-like fine inspiratory crackles. Laboratory studies showed a normal complete blood count, metabolic panel, liver function tests, cardiac enzymes, BNP, lactate, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen and TSH. D-dimer was elevated at 15.4 (normal <1.6). ESR was 52 mm/hour. Rheumatoid factor was <5 (negative). ANA, p-ANCA and c-ANCA were negative. Blood cultures (bacterial/fungal/mycobacterial), urine legionella and streptococcal antigen were negative. Viral respiratory panel, including cytomegalovirus & Herpes Simplex Virus PCR were also negative. ABG showed hypoxemia with respiratory alkalosis. Pulmonary function tests showed restrictive pattern of lung disease. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal cardiac chamber sizes and left ventricular ejection fraction of 81%.\n",
      "Plain chest radiograph (Fig. ) showed bilateral basilar infiltrates and a peripheral reticulonodular pattern superimposed on generalized interstitial changes, involving the upper lobes as well as lung bases. High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) of the chest (Fig. and ) revealed moderate to severe thickening of intralobular septa, septal line formation, parenchymal band formation and peribronchial thickening, ground glass opacities and mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy (likely reactive, largest lymph node being 1.1 cm) was noted. This was consistent with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) without a specific pattern. At this time, treatment with levofloxacin was continued and solumedrol was added for empirical therapy. Computed Tomogram (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis was normal with no evidence of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Despite steroid therapy, the patient's respiratory status deteriorated over the next day requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Consequently, consent for wedge biopsy of the lung was obtained for a pathological diagnosis to guide further therapy.\n",
      "A right lung wedge biopsy was obtained by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). A polymorphic lymphoid infiltrate composed of large atypical cells, small lymphocytes and many plasma cells was noted, with lymphoid cells infiltrating blood vessels and bronchial walls (Fig. ). Multinucleated large Reed Sternberg-like cells were also present along with foci of necrosis. Bronchial washings showed atypical benign bronchial cells and pulmonary macrophages with a few rare atypical Reed-Sternberg-like cells. Bone marrow biopsy was normal.\n",
      "Immuno-histochemical studies of lung tissue showed predominance of T cells expressing CD3, CD5 and CD43 with a smaller population of large atypical cells expressing CD20 and CD79a (B cell markers) (Fig. ). Many CD138+ plasma cells exhibiting polyclonal staining pattern for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains were also seen. Bone marrow biopsy revealed normal cellularity with no evidence of lymphoma. In situ hybridization for EBV encoded RNA (EBER) was positive within scattered large lymphoid cells throughout the biopsy specimen (Fig. ).\n",
      "Based on the pathological and immuno-histochemical findings, a diagnosis of Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis was made. Treatment with high dose steroids and rituximab showed significant clinical improvement and he was extubated 4 days after starting therapy. Treatment was continued with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisolone chemotherapy and he showed gradual but slow resolution of clinical and x-ray findings. However, he subsequently developed pancytopenia consequent to chemotherapy, septic shock requiring increasing doses of pressors and acute renal failure which did not respond to aggressive management and he was terminally weaned per family wishes 4 weeks later. A chest-only autopsy revealed diffuse alveolar damage, likely secondary to sepsis or chemotherapy or both, but no evidence of residual LG was noted within the lungs (Fig. ).\n",

      "A 17-year-old female presented with 1-month history of more noticeable weight loss and increased tiredness. Over the last 6 years since immigrating to the United States with her family from Burma and going through puberty, her body habitus has changed to a very thin appearance. This period of time began with menarche, which subsequently demonstrated intermittent oligomenorrhea occasionally alternating with amenorrhea. Apparently, workup by a gynecologist was negative and a yearlong period of oral contraceptive use did little to change the scant flow pattern. She discontinued these 6 months ago. The patient’s diet history revealed 3 meals a day of normal type foods but always smaller portions than other members of her family. Mother agreed that she does not eat much fried or fast foods, usually what is prepared for the family at home. The patient eventually suggested after repetitive questions that there was an increase in early satiety over the last month and she clearly was overall more tired. Five months ago, she had an outpatient visit for viral syndrome with vomiting and diarrhea, which resolved in 48 hours. At that time, her weight was 42 kg and no fever noted. Review of systems was notable for fatigue, intermittent chills, hair loss with nonvigorous brushing, intermittent “shakiness” when getting up, and shortness of breath on exertion. She denied any fever, upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, coughing, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, abdominal pain other than associated with her menstrual cycle, rashes, easy bruising or bleeding. Her past medical history was notable for the oligomenorrhea and scoliosis, but prior testing for anemia reported negative 6 months ago, and all chronic diseases, including in other members of the family, was denied, including anemia, thalassemia, and tuberculosis. The patient reports feeling “sad sometimes” but denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. In the emergency department, her physical exam (PE) was notable for a tired appearing but otherwise well teenage girl with a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate 125, respiratory rate 16, pulse oxygenation saturation of 97% on room air, weight 40 kg, height 144.78 cm, body mass index 20.1, some hair loss with brushing, II/VI systolic murmur over LUSB, and mild nonpitting bilateral edema. The remainder of the PE was unremarkable. Laboratory values were remarkable for white blood cell count 4700/µL with neutrophilic predominance, hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL, hematocrit 24.8%, mean corpuscular volume 74.9 fL, red cell distribution width 18.4%. Chemistry panel was within normal limits except for low albumin 2.9 g/dL, and a slightly elevated aspartate transaminase 54 U/L. Thyroid studies demonstrated slightly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone of 6.68 mIU/L (05-6.0) with normal free T4 of 1.08 ng/dL (0.7-1.9). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated to 65.4 mg/L (normal 0-5) and 132 mm/h (normal 0-20), respectively. Urinalysis was unremarkable and urine pregnancy test was negative. Additional iron studies demonstrated levels of iron 29 µg/dL, ferritin 3 ng/mL, and a total iron binding capacity of 144 µg/dL. Given the severe anemia and elevated inflammatory markers, the decision was made to admit the patient for further workup.\n",

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 56-year-old man presented to a peripheral hospital with a history of severe acute central chest pain accompanied by sweating. He has been suffering from diabetes mellitus for 3 years for which he was taking oral hypoglycemic agent (glibenclamide 5 mg, BID). However, he was not on regular follow-up. He was hypertensive for 3 years and for which he was on regular medication.\n",
      "He was diagnosed with acute ST-segment elevation extensive anterior wall myocardial infarction and was given Streptokinase due to unavailability of reteplase/alteplase. Although the chest pain improved, his post lysis ECG showed poor resolution. However, next morning the ECG showed transient inferior leads ST elevation with fast atrial fibrillation (AF). He was given a bolus intravenous amiodarone (300 mg). While he was on amiodarone infusion, he became hypotensive and dobutamine was started at low dose (5 mcg/kg/min). Eventually, his case was discussed and it was decided he needed a tertiary care hospital. He was shifted with 12 hours for further management.\n",
      "On arrival, his radial arterial blood pressure was 106/70 mmHg, mean arterial BP was 59 mmHg. He was maintained on low dose dobutamine. The PR was 96 b.p.m, in sinus rhythm. His urine output was 75 ml / hour. On physical examination, he had bilateral fine crepitation and a pan systolic murmur at the left lower sternal area, radiating to the right precordium. Further examination showed the jugular venous pulse was mildly raised but no lower leg edema and warm touch. Oxygen saturation was 98% on 4 L/min oxygen facemask.\n",
      "Electrocardiography [] revealed sinus rhythm with persistent ST-segment elevation in the anterior (V1-V6) with established Q-waves in anterior leads. Chest X-ray [] showed bilateral mild pulmonary congestion.\n",
      "Transthoracic echocardiography revealed multiple (2–3 mm) apical muscular ventricular septal defects (VSD) with the largest VSD measuring 1 cm [], and a left to right shunt []. Left ventricular (LV) systolic function was mildly impaired with an ejection fraction of 45%. The left ventricular apex was akinetic. There was Grade-I diastolic dysfunction with normal right side dimension and functions. There was no significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis, but there was moderate pericardial effusion measuring 1.6 cm posteriorly and 1.1 cm anteriorly []. There was no sign of cardiac tamponade. The results of the biochemical Labs were unremarkable except for mild renal impairment (creatinine 105 mmol/L, eGFR-65) and raised Troponin T (364 pg/ml). Lactate level was 2.1mmol/L.\n",
      "Coronary angiography (CAG) revealed the left anterior descending artery had tight lesions in the proximal (95%) and mid segment (85%) with diffusely diseased distal LAD []. Right coronary had proximal 30% stenosis; the right posterior descending artery had ostial (90%) lesion []. There was non-significant lesion at distal left circumflex artery. LV Angiography showed Apical VSR with LV to RV flow [Figure and ].\n",
      "His Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention (SCAI) cardiogenic shock (CS) stage was determined to be Stage B. At this time cardiac surgeons were consulted, who advised to continue medical treatment with an intention to heal infarct area spontaneously and they would consider either for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) plus VSD repair versus Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) plus device closure.\n",
      "The patient was initially treated medically with intravenous diuretics, inotropes, and with oral aspirin and statin. Gradually, all inotropes were tapered off and he was clinically asymptomatic with stable hemodynamics without support of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). Later, low dose of lisinopril and carvedilol was added as vasodilators to reduce afterload.\n",
      "Eventually, at the eighteenth day of admission, the patient underwent CABG (one venous graft to r-PDA) with simultaneous repair of VSD with Gortex patch with infarct exclusion technique. The LAD artery could not be grafted due to poor visualization hence dit was decided for PCI later if needed.\n",
      "Postoperatively, the patient remained stable and was extubated the next day. Follow-up echocardiography revealed no residual intra-cardiac shunt. He was discharged on the 7th post-operative day in stable condition. Due to expatriate issue, a follow-up was arranged over telephone at 2 weeks. After two months, he was asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable and could perform routine daily activities. Later a clinic follow- up was arranged with echocardiography.\n",

      "A 70-year-old man presented with dyspnoea and palpitations on exertion to the emergency department (ED). His medical history was significant for stage IV clear cell RCC, chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation with warfarin, coronary artery disease status post the placement of two stents with an ischaemic cardiomyopathy and a LVEF of 40%–45%. He was recently started on pazopanib for systemic treatment of metastatic RCC. Pazopanib was started at 75% of the recommended dose. At the initiation of therapy, the patient had a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL and was able to walk 90 min a day without any complaints.\n",
      "Within the first week of starting pazopanib, the patient developed dyspnoea on exertion that progressed rapidly to dyspnoea on minimal exertion. He was no longer able to conduct his daily walks. On the 10th day after starting pazopanib, he was unable to shave himself due to dyspnoea, which prompted his ED presentation. In the ED, his blood pressure (BP) was 122/70 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) was 93 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate (RR) was 22 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. On physical examination, auscultation of the heart was significant for an irregular rhythm with no additional heart sounds or signs of volume overload. His lungs were clear to auscultation, and the remainder of the examination was unremarkable.\n",
      "Initial labs were significant for a creatinine of 1.4 mg/mL and a supratherapeutic international normalised ratio of 4.0. Blood counts, electrolytes and liver function tests were within normal limits. His B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 2685 pg/mL. His troponin results were negative. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation without significant changes compared with previous tracings. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest in the ED showed heterogeneous opacification of the left main pulmonary artery with concern for a non-occlusive thrombus.\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the hospital and empirically started on anticoagulation with enoxaparin for presumed pulmonary embolism (PE). On the second day, he presented with worsening shortness of breath and compromised mental status.

      "A 69-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital after returning from a one-month vacation to Myanmar that included horseback riding. The patient had not taken malaria prophylaxis and did not receive any vaccinations prior to his departure. The patient's medical history was remarkable for gout, ciguatera, and neurosurgical reconstruction of the skull after a basilar skull fracture. The latter occurred 5 years before this event (after a fall from a horse), and it was complicated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and right-sided glossopharyngeal and vagal nerve damage, which resulted in right-sided vocal cord paralysis with hoarseness and sporadic aspiration. The patient did not take any medications and did not smoke, but he drank wine regularly.\n",
      "For the last few days, the patient had been increasingly tired and somnolent, with complaints of headache, left-sided ear pain, and night sweats. One day prior to admission, the patient had become increasingly confused. On the day of his admission, he was found by his wife lying on the floor of his home, confused, agitated, shivering, and incontinent of urine. At the emergency department, the patient's temperature was 39.2 °C, and his heart rate was 111 beats per minute, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and a blood pressure of 161/88 mmHg. The patient's peripheral oxygen saturation was 87%, and his Glasgow Coma Scale was scored as 9 (E2 M5 V2). Clinical examination revealed fasciculations of the face and lower legs and crepitation over the right lower lung on pulmonary auscultation. There was no purpura or nuchal rigidity.\n",
      "At that time, blood results revealed a leukocyte count of 34 900 × 109/l (normal: 4 300–10 000) (>95% being neutrophils) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 204 mg/l (normal value <3). A chest X-ray revealed no abnormalities. A CT scan of the brain showed only nonspecific white matter lesions but no haemorrhage or oedema. Lumbar puncture examination revealed a leukocyte count of 1160/mm3 (almost all neutrophils), a normal glucose level, and a total protein level of 128 mg/dl (normal value 15–40) accompanied by an elevated lactate level of 6.1 meq/l. Gram stain showed irregularly shaped cocci. Bacterial meningitis was suspected, and after obtaining two sets of blood cultures, empirical therapy with 2 g of intravenous ceftriaxone every 12 h, 2 g of ampicillin every 4 h and 10 mg/kg of acyclovir every 8 h was initiated. Shortly after starting the antibiotic therapy, the patient became more somnolent and developed a left-sided hemiplegia, left-sided central facial palsy, and right-sided head and eye deviation, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Because of increasingly obstructive respirations and an increasing oxygen need by the next day, the patient was intubated and ventilated.\n",
      "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures showed β-hemolytic colonies; blood and CSF cultures were positive for Streptococcus equi. Intravenous treatment with 2 g of ceftriaxone every 12 h was continued for 21 days, while ampicillin and acyclovir were discontinued. In vitro testing confirmed a sensitivity to ceftriaxone. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (FLAIR) showed a “dirty CSF” appearance in the right parietal region (, white arrow). Axial () and sagittal () T1-weighted images after the intravenous administration of gadolinium-chelate revealed a focal area of superficial contrast enhancement overlying the cerebral cortex, presumably representing a thickened pia mater and opacification of the left mastoid. In view of the MRI lesions and the left hemiplegia, one gram of intravenous methylprednisolone once daily was added to the treatment for 3 days with gradual tapering afterwards because meningoencephalitis with accompanying cerebral vasculitis was suspected []. After 4 days, the patient was weaned from the ventilator and extubated. Initially, the patient remained very agitated and disoriented and was temporarily treated with 25 mg of twice daily quetiapine and 100 mg of daily trazodone. Nine days after admission to the ICU, the patient was transferred to the neurology department. Later, this Streptococcus equi was identified as S. equi subspecies equi (at the National Reference Center for Invasive Non-Group B Beta-Hemolytic Streptococci, Belgium).\n",
      "The patient initially recovered completely and had no complaints apart from mild gait disturbances and light-headedness at a follow-up appointment 3 months after discharge. Because of the patient's prior medical history of basilar skull fracture and opacification of the left mastoid on brain MRI, despite a lack of clinical evidence of acute otitis or mastoiditis, an additional CT scan of the base of the skull was performed to rule out possible portals of entry for central nervous system (CNS) infection. The CT scan revealed only an asymmetrical widening of the left squamosal suture; therefore, we opted for a conservative approach.\n",
      "One month later (5 months after the initial referral), the patient was readmitted with intracranial bleeding, and consecutive CT scans showed multiple right-sided cerebral haemorrhages, with the largest located precentrally in the frontal lobe with small perilesional parietal and temporal haemorrhages accompanied by a left hemiparesis and aphasia (). CT angiography examination (, para-axial MPR) showed multiple tortuous, engorged pial veins of the right hemisphere. Cerebral angiography confirmed the presence of a suspected superficial dural arteriovenous fistula (, lateral projection of right internal carotid artery injection, large black arrow) in the right parietal region. The arterial feeders were mainly meningeal branches originating from the right ophthalmic artery and transosseous feeders from the right superficial temporal and occipital arteries (, lateral projection right external carotid artery injection); in addition, there was limited arterial supply to the fistula from the left middle meningeal artery across the midline (not shown).

      "A 69-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital after returning from a one-month vacation to Myanmar that included horseback riding. The patient had not taken malaria prophylaxis and did not receive any vaccinations prior to his departure. The patient's medical history was remarkable for gout, ciguatera, and neurosurgical reconstruction of the skull after a basilar skull fracture. The latter occurred 5 years before this event (after a fall from a horse), and it was complicated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and right-sided glossopharyngeal and vagal nerve damage, which resulted in right-sided vocal cord paralysis with hoarseness and sporadic aspiration. The patient did not take any medications and did not smoke, but he drank wine regularly.\n",
      "For the last few days, the patient had been increasingly tired and somnolent, with complaints of headache, left-sided ear pain, and night sweats. One day prior to admission, the patient had become increasingly confused. On the day of his admission, he was found by his wife lying on the floor of his home, confused, agitated, shivering, and incontinent of urine. At the emergency department, the patient's temperature was 39.2 °C, and his heart rate was 111 beats per minute, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and a blood pressure of 161/88 mmHg. The patient's peripheral oxygen saturation was 87%, and his Glasgow Coma Scale was scored as 9 (E2 M5 V2). Clinical examination revealed fasciculations of the face and lower legs and crepitation over the right lower lung on pulmonary auscultation. There was no purpura or nuchal rigidity.\n",
      "At that time, blood results revealed a leukocyte count of 34 900 × 109/l (normal: 4 300–10 000) (>95% being neutrophils) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 204 mg/l (normal value <3). A chest X-ray revealed no abnormalities. A CT scan of the brain showed only nonspecific white matter lesions but no haemorrhage or oedema. Lumbar puncture examination revealed a leukocyte count of 1160/mm3 (almost all neutrophils), a normal glucose level, and a total protein level of 128 mg/dl (normal value 15–40) accompanied by an elevated lactate level of 6.1 meq/l. Gram stain showed irregularly shaped cocci.

      "A 71-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension presented to our community emergency department (ED) transported by emergency medical services (EMS) with the chief complaints of chest pain, difficulty breathing, back pain, and weakness of both lower extremities. He had an abrupt onset of chest pain, described as a sharp and stabbing pain, while using his rototiller in the garden, 6 h prior to arrival. His symptoms continued to progress to the point that he was having difficulty breathing and starting to have trouble walking for which EMS was called. Per EMS, they noted rapidly progressing symptoms while en route to the ED. Vitals on arrival to the ED are as follows: 94.5 °F, blood pressure of 91/64 mmHg, heart rate of 109 beats/min, respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min, and 100% pulse oximetry on room air. On physical exam, he was toxic appearing, in acute distress, and diaphoretic. Jugular venous distention was present. Cardiopulmonary exam was notable for tachycardia, distant heart sounds, and the presence of bibasilar rales. His skin/lower extremities were pale, mottled, and he was unable to move them. Carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally, radial pules 1+ bilaterally, femoral pulses 1+ bilaterally, with absent popliteal pulses. On neurological exam, he had dysarthric speech, left-sided facial droop, and loss of strength and sensation in his lower extremities.\n",
      "The patient was placed on non-invasive positive pressure. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia with premature atrial complexes, a right bundle branch block, with non-specific ST/T wave changes in the anterior leads. Portable chest radiography taken in an upright position (Fig. ) demonstrated a widened mediastinum at about 10.5 cm. A bedside point of care cardiac ultrasound revealed a significant pericardial effusion. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast was unremarkable for any acute process. Pertinent laboratory evaluation:\n",
      "Hemoglobin of 9.2 (13.5–17 g/dL) Arterial blood gas: pH 7.01, pCO2 45, p02 116, HCO3 12 Initial lactic acid of 8.3 (0.5–2.2 mmol/L) that increased to 14.8 Blood/urea/nitrogen of 42 (8–22 mg/dL) Creatinine of 3.06 (0.6–1.4 mg/dL).\n",
      "CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast revealed a Stanford type A dissection with an intimal tear beginning at the level of the aortic root and extending throughout the course of the thoracic aorta and into the abdominal aorta (Figs. , , and ). Additional findings on CT included involvement of the origins of the great vessels (brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery). Hemopericardium is visualized with high suspicion for pericardial tamponade. There is dilation of the ascending thoracic aorta measuring up to 5.2 cm. The dissection continues distally (Figs. and ) to involve the left common iliac artery and bilateral external iliac arteries.\n",
      "He was transferred emergently to a tertiary center and was taken immediately to the operating room for definitive repair. The patient underwent sternotomy, repair of Stanford type A dissection with right groin cannulation, and repair of the right femoral artery and vein. He arrived in the surgical intensive care unit in guarded condition, his sternotomy was left open secondary to severe coagulopathy intraoperatively, and he was on an epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin infusion. By day 2, continuous renal replacement therapy (CCRT) was initiated for acute tubular necrosis. Vascular surgery was consulted to evaluate a pulseless right lower extremity status post right femoral artery cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass. Given the patient had an open sternotomy with five chest tubes with significant output requiring transfusion of multiple blood products throughout the night, vascular surgery could not perform a femoral-femoral bypass or axillofemoral bypass without heparinization.\n",
      "By day 3, he underwent mediastinal irrigation and sternal closure with cardiothoracic surgery. He was then taken for a right common femoral endarterectomy, iliofemoral and lower extremity embolectomy, and right lower extremity four-compartment fasciotomy secondary to acute ischemia of the right lower extremity. In addition, neurosurgery evaluated the patient because he was not spontaneously moving his extremities after surgery and there was concern that the dissection had caused an infarction of his thoracic spinal cord, resulting in paraplegia. By day 4, he remained stuporous off sedation and on maximum pressor support (norepinephrine infusion at 30 mcg/min, epinephrine infusion at 10 mcg/min, and a vasopressin infusion at 0.04 units/min). He continued to have upper extremity non-epileptic myoclonic jerks secondary to continued renal failure. CT of the head revealed multiple 1 to 2 cm foci consistent with likely subacute infarcts related to embolic disease. By day 5, a family discussion was had regarding a poor neurological prognosis for independent neurological recovery with likely permanent cognitive and motor deficits. His code status was subsequently changed to do not resuscitate (DNR) with no further escalation of care. The patient continued to deteriorate throughout the night, became asystolic, and expired.\n",

      "He was transferred emergently to a tertiary center and was taken immediately to the operating room for definitive repair. The patient underwent sternotomy, repair of Stanford type A dissection with right groin cannulation, and repair of the right femoral artery and vein. He arrived in the surgical intensive care unit in guarded condition, his sternotomy was left open secondary to severe coagulopathy intraoperatively, and he was on an epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin infusion. By day 2, continuous renal replacement therapy (CCRT) was initiated for acute tubular necrosis. Vascular surgery was consulted to evaluate a pulseless right lower extremity status post right femoral artery cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass. Given the patient had an open sternotomy with five chest tubes with significant output requiring transfusion of multiple blood products throughout the night, vascular surgery could not perform a femoral-femoral bypass or axillofemoral bypass without heparinization.\n",
      "By day 3, he underwent mediastinal irrigation and sternal closure with cardiothoracic surgery. He was then taken for a right common femoral endarterectomy, iliofemoral and lower extremity embolectomy, and right lower extremity four-compartment fasciotomy secondary to acute ischemia of the right lower extremity. In addition, neurosurgery evaluated the patient because he was not spontaneously moving his extremities after surgery and there was concern that the dissection had caused an infarction of his thoracic spinal cord, resulting in paraplegia. By day 4, he remained stuporous off sedation and on maximum pressor support (norepinephrine infusion at 30 mcg/min, epinephrine infusion at 10 mcg/min, and a vasopressin infusion at 0.04 units/min). He continued to have upper extremity non-epileptic myoclonic jerks secondary to continued renal failure. CT of the head revealed multiple 1 to 2 cm foci consistent with likely subacute infarcts related to embolic disease. By day 5, a family discussion was had regarding a poor neurological prognosis for independent neurological recovery with likely permanent cognitive and motor deficits. His code status was subsequently changed to do not resuscitate (DNR) with no further escalation of care. The patient continued to deteriorate throughout the night, became asystolic, and expired.\n",

      "A 71-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department after being found unconscious and hypoxemic in front of his house. He had a history of alcohol- and nicotine-abuse and lived a reclusive life. One week prior he had visited his general practitioner because of dyspnea. He was prescribed oral steroids and bronchodilators for presumed exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n",
      "On physical examination he looked ill, was haemodynamically stable and hypercapnic. His body temperature was 37.2 °C. His blood pressure was 154/66 mmHg, with a regular pulse of 116 beats min−1. He was tachypneic, respiration rate of 27 min−1, with a peripheral oxygen saturation of 97 % with a non-rebreathing mask. Lung auscultation revealed weak breath sounds. Further physical examination revealed a wound between his first and second toe on his right foot in which a great number of maggots were present (). Signs of chronic venous insufficiency were present, but no signs of arterial insufficiency. The remaining physical examination was unremarkable. Haematological and biochemical investigations showed a white blood cell count of 17.9×109 l−1[reference range (ref.) 4–10×109 l−1], with 81 % neutrophils (ref. 40–75 %), C-reactive protein 51 mg l−1 (ref. <10), glucose level of 257.6 mg dl−1 (ref. 72.1–115.1) and otherwise normal results for haemoglobin level, platelet count, liver enzymes, electrolytes and creatinine. Arterial blood-gas analysis showed a marked respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.19 and pCO2 of 12.1 kPa. A chest X-ray did not reveal signs of pneumonia. He was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit and non-invasive ventilation was started with a diagnosis of exacerbation of his COPD without an apparent trigger, possibly upper respiratory tract infection. Steroids, bronchodilators and a broad-spectrum antibiotic (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) were given. Two days later he was transferred to the pulmonology ward. Two blood culture sets each containing one aerobic and one anaerobic bottle (BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F and Anaerobic/F Culture Vials using the BACTEC FX system; Becton Dickinson) drawn upon admission revealed growth of Gram-negative rods in one of the aerobic bottles after incubation for 48 h. Upon subculturing of the Gram-negative rod, an oxidase-positive, aerobic, catalase-positive strain was found. Determination by Vitek2Combo with ID-GN card (bioMérieux) revealed Acinetobacter iwoffii with 98 % probabil ity. API NE tests (bioMérieux) could not assign the strain to a specific species. The above results were conflicting with colony morphology and oxidase reaction. A RapID-ANA test (Remel) was done to test for enzymatic reactions that could possibly provide a clue to the identification. Positive reactions for urease, arginine and serine hydrolysis were found. Although we even considered this strain to be a non-fermentative contaminant, the combination of the positive oxidase reaction and the growth characteristics finally let us consider Wohlfahrtiimonas species as we knew the patient had a wound full with maggots. However , a positive urease reaction is not compatible with Wohlfahrtiimonas. We offered the strain to an external laboratory (BaseClear, Leiden, The Netherlands) for identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (VITEK MS; bioMérieux) and MicroSEQ analysis, a 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing method (Life Technologies). MALDI-TOF MS did not reveal a reliable result (VITEK MS industry database v2.0) and even the MicroSEQ analysis with the validated database was unsuccessful. To our complete surprise a species of the genusIgnatzschineria was identified when the 489 basepair 16S rRNA gene sequence was blasted against the NCBI and SMARTgene databases. The colony morphology, growth characteristics, oxidase and urease reaction were all compatible with this identification as well as the clinical story. The complete 16S rRNA gene was amplified and analysed. The resulting sequence (1392 nucleotides) showed 98.7, 98.5 and 98.2 % similarity, respectively to the type strains of Ignatzschineria ureiclastica, Ignatzschineria larvae and Ignatzschineria indica (GenBank accession numbers , and ). shows a phylogenetic tree displaying the relations with close proximate species. The sequence was submitted to the GenBank database and assigned accession number . Antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed by Etest (bioMérieux) revealed minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid of 0.25 mg l−1, amoxicillin 0.047 mg l−1 and ciprofloxacin 0.064 mg l−1. A beta-lactamase test (Oxoid) was positive. According to EUCAST non-species related breakpoints all these antibiotics could be considered sensitive based on Pk/Pd data. The positive beta-lactamase test argues against amoxicillin as appropriate treatment. The in vitro sensitivity to amoxicillin by Etest in conjunction with a positive beta-lactamase test is suggestive of an inducible beta-lactamase. A culture of the wound on the right foot of the patient taken two days after start of antimicrobial treatment and admission did only reveal Providencia stuartii. Even with the knowledge of the blood culture result we could not find species of the genus Ignatzschineria in this culture. A two-week course of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was completed with good clinical response. The wound on the patient's foot was successfully treated with application of povidone-iodine (betadine) and low adherent highly absorbent (melonin) dressings. His pulmonary condition improved, elevated glucose level and venous insufficiency were taken care of and he gradually improved and was discharged three weeks after admission.\n",

Hemodynamically, he showed a stable profile with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 84 bpm. His body temperature was 38.1°C. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated C-reactive protein concentration of 37 mg/L (reference: <5 mg/L), a leukocyte count of 7.7 × 109/L (reference: 4–10 × 109/L) and D-dimer of 0.41 mg/L (reference: <0.50 mg/L).

      "A 26-year-old Somalian woman (Gravida 2, Para 1) who had been living in Sweden for a year presented at the Emergency Department of Skåne University Hospital in Malmö on April 17th, 2020 pregnant at 32 + 1 weeks of gestation. She was transferred to the Infectious Diseases Department with suspicion of COVID-19. A diagnostic test, based on quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), from a nasopharyngeal swab, was positive for SARS-CoV-2.\n",
      "She had recently moved from Stockholm to Malmö. In 2015 she had a normal vaginal delivery in Somalia. The patient had an appendectomy and a cholecystectomy in Somalia. Her medical history also included hypothyroidism, currently treated with 150 ug Levothyroxine daily. The body mass index (BMI) on admission to prenatal care was 47 kg/m2 with length 163 centimetres (cm), weight 126 kg (kg). Apart from the obesity, her pregnancy had been without complications. She had received an intramuscular injection of Anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 + 5 weeks of gestation since she was Rhesus D (RhD) negative and the fetus was RhD positive.\n",
      "On admission, the patient described a nine-day history of shortness of breath, dry cough, myalgia, nausea, abdominal pain and fever (Fig. 1). She had significant abdominal pain on admission but the surgeon did not find any signs of an acute abdominal event. The patient had also noticed reduced fetal movements for the last two days. Obstetric examination including cardio-tocography (CTG) and an abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormalities.\n",
      "The patient’s respiratory rate was 22 breaths/minute, oxygen saturation 95%, blood pressure 116/71, pulse 113 beats/minute and temperature 37.2 degrees Celsius (oC). The laboratory tests are shown in Table . The patient was given morphine, paracetamol and oxycodone for pain relief and also received thromboprophylaxis, Dalteparin 7500 units /day subcutaneously. No additional oxygen was needed.\n",
      "On day 2 (18/4/2020), the patient was relatively stable apart from two short episodes of fever up to 38.9 oC. Due to risk for preterm labour, the patient received 12 milligrams (mg) of Betamethasone intramuscularly to aid fetal lung maturity. Daily fetal monitoring using CTG showed no signs of fetal distress.\n",
      "The patient was discharged on day 3 (19/4/2020) with a planned obstetric follow-up including fetal growth assessment after recovery. She was prescribed dalteparin for four weeks.\n",
      "The patient returned to the Emergency Department the next day (20/4/2020) with a sore throat and severe difficulties in swallowing. Apart from tachypnoea (25–35 breaths/minute) and tachycardia (118 beats/minute), other vital signs were normal. After examination, she was discharged with a prescription of Betamethasone tablets for three days (6, 4 and 3 mg) for swallowing difficulties and potassium supplements for the hypokalaemia noted in the blood tests (Table ).\n",
      "The patient was readmitted to the Infectious Diseases Department the next day (21/4/2020) (Fig. ). Her COVID-19 symptoms (cough, myalgia, abdominal pain and fever) had worsened and she now presented with dyspnoea. At readmission, the patient’s respiratory rate 42 breaths/minute, blood pressure 114/61, pulse was 120 beats/minute and temperature 38.9 oC. During episodes of coughing, her oxygen saturation fell to 86%, but with 5 L of oxygen on mask the saturation rose to 99%. Laboratory tests are shown in Table .\n",
      "Her condition deteriorated on day 2 (22/4/2020) of the readmission. In addition to the generalized pain and tenderness, the pain in her right upper abdomen had worsened. Blood tests showed elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ferritin concentrations. There was impaired coagulation as shown by a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), high D-dimer, falling platelet count and decreased level of Anti-thrombin III (Table ). Hemolysis was indicated by a fall in the hemoglobin concentration and rising lactate dehydrogenase levels although haptoglobin concentrations only were slightly elevated (Table ). Despite her worsening condition, the patient felt active fetal movements and normal intermittent CTG controls were registered. Intravenous antibiotic treatment with Cefotaxime (2 g, 3 times daily) was initiated due to suspicion of concomitant bacterial infection (Table ). Blood and urine cultures were taken but since the general condition of the patient had worsened, a decision was made to deliver by Caesarean section (32 + 6 gestational weeks), on maternal indication. The operation was performed in spinal analgesia in an operating theatre with negative air ventilation. The local hospital guidelines were followed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 []. An uncomplicated operation was completed within 40 min and the total blood loss was 200 millilitres (mL).\n",
      "After two hours in the post-operative unit, the patient returned to the ward and received thromboprophylaxis, dalteparin at a total dose of 10.000 units divided in two doses. A computed tomography (CT) lung scan, performed later the same day, showed bilateral diffuse, ground-glass opacities with both peripheral and perihilar distribution, but no signs of pulmonary embolism (Fig. ).\n",
      "Due to deranged liver values, the patient was unable to receive paracetamol and due to the COVID-19 infection not able to receive ibuprofen []. The pain relief was managed by administering 2.5 mL of intravenous morphine as needed. However, the patient’s condition worsened during the night and on examination, the patient was somnolent and lethargic but answered adequately when woken up (Reaction Level Scale 2). The patient’s pain was mostly localized to the upper right quadrant of the abdomen and epigastrium. Her uterus was well contracted and there were no signs of postoperative complications such as bleedings and local infection. On examination, the patient had miotic pupils that reacted poorly to light stimulation. Even though the patient only was given 7.5 mg of morphine over the course of 8 h, a morphine over-dose was suspected, and intravenous morphine was replaced by a combination of orally administered Naloxone and Oxycodone. Post-operative mobilization was initiated one day after surgery where after the patient made a steady recovery.\n",
      "Table illustrates the drastic improvement in the patient’s blood tests on day 3 (23/4/2020) of the readmission. The patient was discharged in good health on the 30th of April, 2020 with thromboprophylaxis planned for 6 weeks postpartum and a follow-up visit to the Obstetrics Clinic.\n",
      "A male baby was delivered with birth weight 2085 g (37th percentile), birth length 48 cm (99th percentile) and head circumference 33.5 cm (99th percentile). The cord was clamped immediately after birth and the baby was shown briefly to the mother before being taken to a neonatal resuscitation station. At 1-minute after delivery, the baby had a normal heart rate but was gasping and had absent tone and no spontaneous movements. Positive pressure ventilation by a T-piece (neopuff) was given with peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) 20 cmH2O and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) between 5 and 7 cmH2O intermittently during the first seven minutes of life. At ten minutes, the baby was spontaneously breathing, albeit grunting, through T-piece continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with preductal oxygen saturation between 90–95% at FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) 0.4. Fine crackles could be heard on lung auscultation. Intermittent intercostal retractions were also seen. Skin colour, tone and reflex irritability improved gradually during the stabilisation process. Apgar score; 1 min: 4 (appearance 1, pulse 2, reflex irritability 0, activity 1, respiration 0), 5 min: 6 (appearance 1, pulse 2, reflex irritability 1, activity 1, respiration 1), 10 min: 8 (appearance 2, pulse 2, reflex irritability 1, activity 1, respiration 2). Vitamin K was given intramuscularly and a nasogastric tube was inserted. Nasal CPAP with PEEP 6 cmH2O was started.\n",
      "Arterial umbilical cord blood gas showed mild combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis with pH 7.28, partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) 3.45 (kilopascal) kPa, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) 6.97 kPa and base excess − 6.8.\n",
      "The baby was put in an incubator and transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) with negative pressure ventilation. It was given preterm formula supplemented with intravenous glucose infusion. Venous blood gas was analysed at 4 h of age: pH 7.27, pO2 5 kPa, pCO2 7.3 kPa, BE -1.8, Hb 184 g/l and lactate 2.7 mmol/l.\n",
      "After parental consent, formula was changed to donated breast milk. The mother was supplied with a breast pump and instructed in its use. After the initial need of breathing support and supplemental oxygen during day one of life the baby has enjoyed an uneventful clinical course. Nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection were collected at 48 and 96 h of life and were found to be negative in both instances.\n",

She had significant abdominal pain on admission but the surgeon did not find any signs of an acute abdominal event. The patient had also noticed reduced fetal movements for the last two days. Obstetric examination including cardio-tocography (CTG) and an abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormalities.\n",
      "The patient’s respiratory rate was 22 breaths/minute, oxygen saturation 95%, blood pressure 116/71, pulse 113 beats/minute and temperature 37.2 degrees Celsius (oC). The laboratory tests are shown in Table . The patient was given morphine, paracetamol and oxycodone for pain relief and also received thromboprophylaxis, Dalteparin 7500 units /day subcutaneously. No additional oxygen was needed.\n",
      "On day 2 (18/4/2020), the patient was relatively stable apart from two short episodes of fever up to 38.9 oC. Due to risk for preterm labour, the patient received 12 milligrams (mg) of Betamethasone intramuscularly to aid fetal lung maturity. Daily fetal monitoring using CTG showed no signs of fetal distress.\n",
      "The patient was discharged on day 3 (19/4/2020) with a planned obstetric follow-up including fetal growth assessment after recovery. She was prescribed dalteparin for four weeks.\n",
      "The patient returned to the Emergency Department the next day (20/4/2020) with a sore throat and severe difficulties in swallowing. Apart from tachypnoea (25–35 breaths/minute) and tachycardia (118 beats/minute), other vital signs were normal. After examination, she was discharged with a prescription of Betamethasone tablets for three days (6, 4 and 3 mg) for swallowing difficulties and potassium supplements for the hypokalaemia noted in the blood tests (Table ).\n",
      "The patient was readmitted to the Infectious Diseases Department the next day (21/4/2020) (Fig. ). Her COVID-19 symptoms (cough, myalgia, abdominal pain and fever) had worsened and she now presented with dyspnoea. At readmission, the patient’s respiratory rate 42 breaths/minute, blood pressure 114/61, pulse was 120 beats/minute and temperature 38.9 oC. During episodes of coughing, her oxygen saturation fell to 86%, but with 5 L of oxygen on mask the saturation rose to 99%. Laboratory tests are shown in Table .\n",
      "Her condition deteriorated on day 2 (22/4/2020) of the readmission. In addition to the generalized pain and tenderness, the pain in her right upper abdomen had worsened. Blood tests showed elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ferritin concentrations. There was impaired coagulation as shown by a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), high D-dimer, falling platelet count and decreased level of Anti-thrombin III (Table ). Hemolysis was indicated by a fall in the hemoglobin concentration and rising lactate dehydrogenase levels although haptoglobin concentrations only were slightly elevated (Table ). Despite her worsening condition, the patient felt active fetal movements and normal intermittent CTG controls were registered. Intravenous antibiotic treatment with Cefotaxime (2 g, 3 times daily) was initiated due to suspicion of concomitant bacterial infection (Table ). Blood and urine cultures were taken but since the general condition of the patient had worsened, a decision was made to deliver by Caesarean section (32 + 6 gestational weeks), on maternal indication. The operation was performed in spinal analgesia in an operating theatre with negative air ventilation. The local hospital guidelines were followed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 []. An uncomplicated operation was completed within 40 min and the total blood loss was 200 millilitres (mL).\n",
      "After two hours in the post-operative unit, the patient returned to the ward and received thromboprophylaxis, dalteparin at a total dose of 10.000 units divided in two doses. A computed tomography (CT) lung scan, performed later the same day, showed bilateral diffuse, ground-glass opacities with both peripheral and perihilar distribution, but no signs of pulmonary embolism (Fig. ).\n",
      "Due to deranged liver values, the patient was unable to receive paracetamol and due to the COVID-19 infection not able to receive ibuprofen []. The pain relief was managed by administering 2.5 mL of intravenous morphine as needed. However, the patient’s condition worsened during the night and on examination, the patient was somnolent and lethargic but answered adequately when woken up (Reaction Level Scale 2). The patient’s pain was mostly localized to the upper right quadrant of the abdomen and epigastrium. Her uterus was well contracted and there were no signs of postoperative complications such as bleedings and local infection. On examination, the patient had miotic pupils that reacted poorly to light stimulation. Even though the patient only was given 7.5 mg of morphine over the course of 8 h, a morphine over-dose was suspected, and intravenous morphine was replaced by a combination of orally administered Naloxone and Oxycodone. Post-operative mobilization was initiated one day after surgery where after the patient made a steady recovery.\n",
      "Table illustrates the drastic improvement in the patient’s blood tests on day 3 (23/4/2020) of the readmission. The patient was discharged in good health on the 30th of April, 2020 with thromboprophylaxis planned for 6 weeks postpartum and a follow-up visit to the Obstetrics Clinic.\n",
      "A male baby was delivered with birth weight 2085 g (37th percentile), birth length 48 cm (99th percentile) and head circumference 33.5 cm (99th percentile). The cord was clamped immediately after birth and the baby was shown briefly to the mother before being taken to a neonatal resuscitation station. At 1-minute after delivery, the baby had a normal heart rate but was gasping and had absent tone and no spontaneous movements. Positive pressure ventilation by a T-piece (neopuff) was given with peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) 20 cmH2O and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) between 5 and 7 cmH2O intermittently during the first seven minutes of life. At ten minutes, the baby was spontaneously breathing, albeit grunting, through T-piece continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with preductal oxygen saturation between 90–95% at FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) 0.4. Fine crackles could be heard on lung auscultation. Intermittent intercostal retractions were also seen. Skin colour, tone and reflex irritability improved gradually during the stabilisation process. Apgar score; 1 min: 4 (appearance 1, pulse 2, reflex irritability 0, activity 1, respiration 0), 5 min: 6 (appearance 1, pulse 2, reflex irritability 1, activity 1, respiration 1), 10 min: 8 (appearance 2, pulse 2, reflex irritability 1, activity 1, respiration 2). Vitamin K was given intramuscularly and a nasogastric tube was inserted. Nasal CPAP with PEEP 6 cmH2O was started.\n",
      "Arterial umbilical cord blood gas showed mild combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis with pH 7.28, partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) 3.45 (kilopascal) kPa, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) 6.97 kPa and base excess − 6.8.\n",
      "The baby was put in an incubator and transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) with negative pressure ventilation. It was given preterm formula supplemented with intravenous glucose infusion. Venous blood gas was analysed at 4 h of age: pH 7.27, pO2 5 kPa, pCO2 7.3 kPa, BE -1.8, Hb 184 g/l and lactate 2.7 mmol/l.\n",
      "After parental consent, formula was changed to donated breast milk. The mother was supplied with a breast pump and instructed in its use. After the initial need of breathing support and supplemental oxygen during day one of life the baby has enjoyed an uneventful clinical course. Nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection were collected at 48 and 96 h of life and were found to be negative in both instances.\n",

      "This study presents a case of a 21-year-old male patient with T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma status post induction chemotherapy with lineage switch to acute myelogenous leukemia. He received high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation (TBI), and later received a matched unrelated donor blood stem cell transplantation. His post-transplant course was complicated by biopsy proven chronic graft-versus-host disease in the gastrointestinal tract requiring daily steroid use. He also developed Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis, BK virus-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, Candida glabrata fungemia, and Streptococcus viridans bacteremia-all of which were appropriately treated and resolved.\n",
      "Eleven months after his stem cell transplant, he presented with acute onset of copious blood-tinged phlegm, shortness of breath and left pleuritic chest pain. Upon initial evaluation, the patient was afebrile, respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute, pulse 180 beats per minute, blood pressure 90/67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 91% on room air. Broad-spectrum antibiotics including intravenous vancomycin and antifungals were started. The patient later was hypotensive with blood pressure of 70/46 despite aggressive intravenous hydration. Due to septic shock, intravenous norepinephrine drip was started in the intensive care unit. Laboratory studies were significant for pancytopenia with white blood cell count of 2.79 x 103 cells/µL. Intravenous steroids were started given septic shock and patient’s known history of chronic steroid use due to chronic GVHD. Electrolytes and renal function were unremarkable. Arterial blood gas was significant for PaO2 of 64 mmHg. Blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA). A chest CT scan as seen in Figure showed left lower lobe consolidation in the setting of multiple bilateral cavitary nodules.\n",
      "The infectious disease service was consulted. Blood cultures grew methicillin resistant Staphyloccocus aureus. Given the patient had not been hospitalized recently, it was determined that he had community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) bacteremia. Bronchoscopy was done and was remarkable for the presence of purulent secretions in the tracheobronchial tree. Respiratory culture from bronchoscopy also grew methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The rest of the infectious workup from the bronchoscopy was unremarkable. A transthoracic echocardiogram was ordered to evaluate for the possibility of endocarditis. The echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%, mild global hypokinesis, and no evidence of vegetation suggestive of endocarditis. After a few days of treatment, the patient had significant clinical improvement and blood cultures were negative. He was discharged with a two week course of intravenous vancomycin which he completed.\n",
      "Two months later, the patient was admitted to the hospital for fevers, productive cough with green sputum, and shortness of breath. He was found to have recurrent MRSA bacteremia and recurrent MRSA pneumonia. The CT chest findings as seen in Figure showed multiple bilateral cavitary nodules consistent with a necrotizing process.\n",
      "Initially, intravenous vancomycin was started, however this was later switched to intravenous linezolid. This was done because the patient had recurrent MRSA bacteremia despite prior intravenous vancomycin therapy. Blood cultures were negative after two days of treatment. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an improved left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-70% and no vegetations were identified. After clinical improvement, the patient was discharged on oral linezolid for six weeks per infectious disease team recommendations. After completing this course he was placed on prophylaxis with oral doxycycline to prevent further CA-MRSA infections.\n",

      "57-year old man presented to emergency department of regional hospital with chest pain, which started after walking in the morning. Dull pain was localized in the middle of his chest and was accompanied with nausea, fatigue and difficult breathing.\n",
      "He had no history of heart problems, but was a former smoker and had elevated cholesterol levels. During last summer, he noticed varicose veins on right groin and was wearing elastic bandage. He had no history of cardiovascular disease, took no medications, had no known allergies and was in good physical condition. His father died at the age of 80 due to cerebrovascular insult and his mother had pulmonary embolism at the age of 74.\n",
      "Since chest pain, dyspnea and fatigue didn't subside he called an ambulance. Upon arrival to emergency department he was pale and hypotensive (102/60 mmHg), heart rate was 100 b.p.m. and respiratory rate 22 breaths/min. Oxygen saturation was 95% while breathing 100% oxygen. His body temperature was 36.6 C°. Beside varicose veins on right groin, his physical examination was unremarkable.\n",
      "On 12-lead ECG there was sinus rhythm with incomplete right bundle branch block, ST segment elevations up to 3 mm in precordial leads V1-V4 and negative T wave in lead III (Figure ).\n",
      "On the basis of ECG changes and clinical presentation, acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was suspected. After receiving aspirin 500 mg, morphine 5 mg i.v., thiethylperazine, unfractionated heparin 5000 IU i.v. and nitroglycerin sublingually, he was immediately transferred to our University medical center for primary coronary intervention (PCI). In case of STEMI, quick referral from local hospital or directly from the field, to catheterisation laboratory is a standard of care in Slovenia. That is why no further diagnostic procedures, which would delay transport to PCI were performed in regional hospital.\n",
      "The coronaroangiography reveled normal ascending aorta, coronary arteries without atherosclerotic lesions and acute occlusion, however there was a small separate conus artery arising from aortic root with embolic occlusion (Figure , additional file ). The affected artery was too small to attempt PCI.\n",
      "On admission to medical intensive care unit (ICU) his first blood tests were available. His white blood cell count was slightly elevated (13.4 109/L), so were troponin I (0.128 μg/l - cut off 0.1 μg/l) and D-dimmer (1172 μg/l - cut off 350 μg/l). 4 hours after the onset of symptoms brain pro-BNP concentration was still normal (332.8 ng/l - cut off 500 ng/L). Lactate concentration was not elevated. Arterial blood gas analysis while breathing 6 liters of oxygen via bi-nasal catheter showed pH 7.41, carbon dioxide pressure of 4.3 kPa, oxygen pressure of 17.3 kPa, bicarbonate concentration of 19.9 mM and BE -3.7 mM.\n",
      "Transthoracic echocardiography reviled good left ventricular systolic function without segmental contraction defects. Right cardiac chambers were enlarged, paradoxical movement of interventricular septum was noted but contractility of right ventricle was not impaired and right heart pressure was estimated to be 40 mmHg + central venous pressure.\n",
      "With bedside transesophageal echocardiography pulmonary embolism was confirmed; thrombi were seen in both pulmonary arteries (Figure , additional file ); right to left intra-atrial communication was diagnosed after contrast application (Figure , additional file ).\n",

      "57-year old man presented to emergency department of regional hospital with chest pain, which started after walking in the morning. Dull pain was localized in the middle of his chest and was accompanied with nausea, fatigue and difficult breathing.\n",
      "He had no history of heart problems, but was a former smoker and had elevated cholesterol levels. During last summer, he noticed varicose veins on right groin and was wearing elastic bandage. He had no history of cardiovascular disease, took no medications, had no known allergies and was in good physical condition. His father died at the age of 80 due to cerebrovascular insult and his mother had pulmonary embolism at the age of 74.\n",
      "Since chest pain, dyspnea and fatigue didn't subside he called an ambulance. Upon arrival to emergency department he was pale and hypotensive (102/60 mmHg), heart rate was 100 b.p.m. and respiratory rate 22 breaths/min. Oxygen saturation was 95% while breathing 100% oxygen. His body temperature was 36.6 C°. Beside varicose veins on right groin, his physical examination was unremarkable.\n",
      "On 12-lead ECG there was sinus rhythm with incomplete right bundle branch block, ST segment elevations up to 3 mm in precordial leads V1-V4 and negative T wave in lead III (Figure ).\n",
      "On the basis of ECG changes and clinical presentation, acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was suspected. After receiving aspirin 500 mg, morphine 5 mg i.v., thiethylperazine, unfractionated heparin 5000 IU i.v. and nitroglycerin sublingually, he was immediately transferred to our University medical center for primary coronary intervention (PCI). In case of STEMI, quick referral from local hospital or directly from the field, to catheterisation laboratory is a standard of care in Slovenia. That is why no further diagnostic procedures, which would delay transport to PCI were performed in regional hospital.\n",
      "The coronaroangiography reveled normal ascending aorta, coronary arteries without atherosclerotic lesions and acute occlusion, however there was a small separate conus artery arising from aortic root with embolic occlusion (Figure , additional file ). The affected artery was too small to attempt PCI.\n",
      "On admission to medical intensive care unit (ICU) his first blood tests were available. His white blood cell count was slightly elevated (13.4 109/L), so were troponin I (0.128 μg/l - cut off 0.1 μg/l) and D-dimmer (1172 μg/l - cut off 350 μg/l). 4 hours after the onset of symptoms brain pro-BNP concentration was still normal (332.8 ng/l - cut off 500 ng/L). Lactate concentration was not elevated. Arterial blood gas analysis while breathing 6 liters of oxygen via bi-nasal catheter showed pH 7.41, carbon dioxide pressure of 4.3 kPa, oxygen pressure of 17.3 kPa, bicarbonate concentration of 19.9 mM and BE -3.7 mM.\n",
      "Transthoracic echocardiography reviled good left ventricular systolic function without segmental contraction defects. Right cardiac chambers were enlarged, paradoxical movement of interventricular septum was noted but contractility of right ventricle was not impaired and right heart pressure was estimated to be 40 mmHg + central venous pressure.\n",
      "With bedside transesophageal echocardiography pulmonary embolism was confirmed; thrombi were seen in both pulmonary arteries (Figure , additional file ); right to left intra-atrial communication was diagnosed after contrast application (Figure , additional file ).\n",
      "At the time of diagnosis of pulmonary embolism he was hemodynamically stable. He received continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin and was soon transferred to step down telemetry unit. Maximal troponin I value of 3.08 μg/l was reached 24 h after admission. ST segment elevations of precordial leads returned to baseline and inverse T waves appeared on leads V1-V3. Ultrasound of lower extremity veins reveled right popliteal vein thrombosis. In a few days heparin infusion was substituted for warfarin and he was discharged.\n",

      "A 74-year-old normotensive, nondiabetic, male smoker (30-pack years) presented with progressively increasing shortness of breath, cough, white, mucoid expectoration, and retrosternal and right sided parasternal, oppressive chest pain for last 2 months. Chest pain and shortness of breath were increased in severity on exertion and were associated with palpitation, but there is no history of sweating, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, unconsciousness, and convulsion. There was no radiation of chest pain. Chest pain was suddenly increased for last five days and the patient was admitted in the emergency department with a suspicion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). There was no history of fever, hemoptysis, leg swelling, and facial puffiness. History of significant weight loss and anorexia were present. There was no history of household contact with the patient of sputum smear positive tuberculosis. The patient received formoterol + tiotropium metered dose inhaler (2 puffs once daily with spacer) and oral doxofylline (400 mg twice daily) for last five years, as he suffered from chronic bronchitis predominant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which resulted in persistent breathlessness, cough, and expectoration.\n",
      "General survey revealed anemia and clubbing, but there was no cyanosis, edema, and engorged neck vein. There were multiple cervical and supraclavicular enlarged lymph nodes on left side, which were hard in consistency, discrete, nontender, and fixed to underlying structure, but not fixed to overlying skin, and there was no discharging sinus. His temperature was 37°C, respiratory rate 24 breaths/minute, pulse rate 120 beats/minute, regular blood pressure 94/64 mmHg, oxygen saturation in capillary blood (SpO2) 96% @ room air, and FiO2 0.21.\n",
      "Examination of respiratory system revealed no abnormality, except vesicular breath sound with prolonged expiration on both sides, bilateral crackles, mainly over the bases of the lungs, and occasional wheezes. Examination of other system was normal. Complete hemogram showed anemia with hemoglobin concentration of 7.1 g/dL. Blood biochemistry was normal. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atypical ST segment elevation and T wave inversion in lateral chest leads (Lead V4, Lead V5, and Lead V6). Initial rapid troponin-t-test was inconclusive, but repeat one after 12 hours of first test was negative. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and Gram stain was negative, and pyogenic culture of sputum showed no growth. Chest X-ray posteroanterior (PA view) showed cardiothoracic ratio was more than 0.5; that is, size of the cardiac silhouette was increased, but lung parenchyma was normal. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of thorax showed a large, nonhomogenous mass lesion in right lower lobe which invaded the left atrium and was compressing the adjacent ventricular walls (). There was also mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. CT-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed discrete clusters of malignant epithelial cells which showed nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, high nucleocytoplasmic ratio, pale cytoplasm, and ill-defined cell boundary—suggestive of non-small-cell carcinoma, possibly squamous cell variety (). FNAC of left sided supraclavicular lymph nodes showed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Sputum for malignant cell was negative and fibre optic bronchoscopy did not show any abnormality. Echocardiogram showed a large echogenic mass of 15 × 12 mm, attached to the roof of the left atrium adjacent to right pulmonary venous openings, encroaching to interatrial septum, an extension of the tumour from adjacent lung parenchyma. Ejection fraction was 66%. Ultrasound of abdomen and CECT scan of brain were normal. Hence the diagnosis was a non-small-cell carcinoma of lower lobe of right lung with invasion of the left atrium and compression of adjacent ventricular wall (T4 disease) with contralateral supraclavicular metastatic lymphadenopathy (N3 disease).

      "A 57-year-old Caucasian male was brought to our emergency department (ED) following an allergic reaction (flushing, chest rash, and drop in blood pressure [BP] to 90/60 mm Hg) to intravenous (i.v.) amiodarone administered by the emergency medical service (EMS) to treat atrial fibrillation. Upon admission, he was anxious and complained of palpitations. He had a history of palpitations and experienced several episodes of irregular heart rhythm following lack of sleep, or periods of work-related stress. He had arterial hypertension for 2 years, and was regularly taking his prescribed medication (5 mg ramipril and 5 mg amlodipine). In his family history, there were no serious diseases and cardiovascular emergencies. His palpitations started 6 hours before presenting to the EMS. An electrocardiogram (ECG) at the EMS showed AF with fast ventricular response (125 bpm). Blood pressure was 180/110 mm Hg and physical examination showed no abnormalities other than irregular heart rhythm on auscultation. He was administered 300 mg amiodarone in 250 mL 5% dextrose solution, and in a matter of minutes had a drop in BP, a rash appeared on his chest, and he complained of flushing. Amiodarone was stopped, and 150 mg propafenone in 250 mL 5% dextrose solution i.v. was admistered as an alternative. This attempt at cardioversion was unsuccessful, and he was transferred to our ED.\n",
      "Upon arrival to our ED he was agitated and complained of palpitations. His physical examination findings were unremarkable other than irregular heart rhythm on heart auscultation.\n",
      "His BP was 130/80 mm Hg, pulse above 125 bpm, pulse oximeter showed 98% oxygenation. His body mass index was 29.2 kg/m2, body temperature 36.7°C. The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with an average ventricular response of 107 bpm. He had left electrical axis and left anterior fascicular block. There were no signs of accessory electrical conduction pathway in ECG. There were no radiological or clinical signs of cardiac decompensation, and we ruled out acute coronary or pulmoembolic syndrome. We performed both transtoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, which showed structurally normal heart with normal heart cavities and good systolic function of the left ventricle, with no visible thrombus. He was on telemetry monitoring during the index hospitalization. After having ruled out immediate and life-threatening causes, such as cardiac ischemia, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary embolism, other possible causes of paroxysmal AF were considered. The common causes of atrial fibrillation are well known, and diagnostic tests revealed no underlying structural heart disease. Thyrotoxicosis was excluded and there were no electrolyte disorders.\n",
      "According to AF treatment guidelines and patient workup results, we decided for rhythm-control strategy rather than rate-control strategy since paroxysmal FA lasted less than 48 hours. Propafenone was prescribed in an oral dose of 150 mg twice a day, bisoprolol 2.5 mg in the morning, and standard thromboprophylaxis with nadroparine 0.8 ml subcutaneously once a day. A betablocator was excluded from therapy due to AF with bradycardic ventricular response (<60 bpm), and a drop of arterial BP to 105/75 mm Hg. He was very anxious and experienced palpitations, therefore we decided to treat him with acupuncture before performing a transesophageal ultrasound. He was scheduled for electrocardioversion for the upcoming day. Acupuncture was administered by a physician accredited at the Croatian Society for Acupuncture, a member of the International Council of Medical Acupuncture and Related Techniques. He was stimulated bilaterally with acupuncture needles (Tewa coated needle PB 2540, 0.25 × 40 mm) at 3 acupuncture points (HT-7, ST-36 and PC-6). Manual stimulation of the acupuncture point was performed until “De-Qui” effect (sensation of numbness, distension, or electrical tingling at the needling site) was produced, and then needles were left for 25 minutes. There was an instant drop of ventricular response rate during treatment and 2 hours after acupuncture therapy cardioversion to sinus rhythm occurred. There was no significant drop of arterial BP during or after acupuncture therapy. He received additional ambulatory acupuncture therapy during 10 treatments every third day in addition to propafenone at peroral dose of 300 mg twice a day. No anticoagulation was recommended due to CHA2DS2-VASC score of zero (0). He was urged to minimize work-related stress and keep a diary of his symptoms.\n",
      "Twenty-four-hour Holter ECG performed after one month showed sinus rhythm with median frequency of 72/min. At 3 month follow-up examination, ECG showed sinus rhythm. No palpitations or other symptoms were reported by the patient. Events and interventions are summarized in the timeline ().

      "A 55-year-old male, with a history of chronic kidney disease for many years, received a living kidney transplant in 2013 and thereafter followed a regular immunosuppressive regimen, including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (0.5 g twice daily), tacrolimus (2 mg twice daily, the concentration was maintained at 4–5 ng/mL.), and methylprednisolone (5 mg once daily) (Fig. ). His creatinine levels were maintained at around 100 μmol/L most of the time, but increased to 180 μmol/L on Jan 15, 2020. He used to experience shortness of breath on exertion. He also had a history of heart failure, regularly taking oral medications, including clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) and aspirin (100 mg once daily), and occasionally taking furosemide (60 mg once daily).\n",
      "The patient presented to a local clinic in Wuhan on Jan 31, 2020, complaining of oliguria for two weeks. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral lung lesions, with a lot of speckle consolidation shadows seen in both lungs. An oropharyngeal swab from this patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2 as shown by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, suggesting that he suffered from pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. He displayed no fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea or vomiting at that time. He was then isolated in a makeshift hospital for further treatment.\n",
      "On Feb 8 (Day 0 of the illness, Day 0), the patient showed a mild cough without sputum, but developed dyspnea by Feb 12 (Day 4). He was then transferred to an intensive care unit in Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China), a site designated for treating severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients on Feb 13 (Day 5). On admission, he had a blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, a pulse of 104 beats per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 94% while breathing ambient air. His laboratory testing showed lymphocytopenia, hypercreatinemia, and increased levels of D-dimers, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cardiac troponin I (Table ). Moreover, his CT images showed bilateral lung interstitial disease, especially near the hilum, with ground-glass opacities (GGO) (Fig. a). A combined strategy was adopted to treat him, including cessation of tacrolimus and methylprednisolone, and initial supportive treatments (oxygen delivery via nasal cannula, furosemide therapy and injection of thymosin α1 and immunoglobulin) (Fig. ). Thymosin α1 is a peptide originally isolated from thymic tissue, and shown to regulate immune function in many diseases, such as sepsis and chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression []. The patient responded well to the therapy.\n",
      "On Feb 20 (Day 12), the patient showed improved clinical symptoms (BP 118/81 mm Hg, HR 84 bpm, RR 16 bpm; the patient displayed good consciousness and spirit and showed no obvious cough, expectoration, fever, chill, abdominal pain, or diarrhea; the patient had a measured SpO2 of 100% when receiving 4 L/min oxygen through a nasal cannula) and was transferred to a general ward. Due to incomplete improvement in imaging results, high levels of CRP (34.6 mg/L) and procalcitonin (0.14 ng/mL) (Table ), as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test on an oropharyngeal swab, the patient received anti-bacterial and anti-viral treatment with beta-methylcarbapenem (0.3 g twice daily) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (1000 mg/d), respectively. During this anti-bacterial and anti-viral therapy period, methylprednisolone (20 mg once daily), gradually reduced MMF dosage, and an adjusted dosage of tacrolimus, were also re-introduced (Fig. ). While the patient subsequently showed improved clinical symptoms, his chest CT images on Feb 24 (Day 11) still showed extensive GGO (images not shown).\n",
      "To identify potential respiratory pathogens associated with the abnormal image findings, several laboratory tests were ordered. On Feb 25 (Day 17), his oropharyngeal swab remained positive for SARS-CoV-2. Microscopic analysis of his expectorated sputum (also Feb 25) did not detect P. jirovecii or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The result of his HIV test was negative. On Feb 28 (Day 20), his serum (1, 3)-beta-D glucan (BDG) level was 89.3 pg/mL, slightly above the normal range (< 70 pg/mL). He was suspected of carrying a fungal infection, especially PJP, based on the positive BDG test, his chest CT features and long immunosuppressive state. However, his impaired kidney function (with high creatinine level) at that time precluded empiric treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Instead, he was treated with micafungin (50 mg IV gtt once daily), an echinocandin that inhibits the synthesis of BDG []. Additionally, the anti-bacterial regimen with beta-methylcarbapenem was maintained empirically. Considering the possibility of lopinavir/ritonavir in increasing the concentration of tacrolimus in his blood, anti-viral treatment was replaced with umifenovir (0.2 g three times daily). After one week of micafungin treatment, serum BDG levels fell within the normal range (61.61 pg/mL). His clinical symptoms and laboratory findings continued to improve (Table ), with chest CT images on Mar 1 (Day 22) and Mar 8 (Day 29) showing gradual absorption of the ground-glass lesions (Fig. b and c). With his oropharyngeal swabs being SARS-CoV-2 negative on Mar 4 (Day 24) and 7 (Day 27), he was discharged on Mar 11 (Day 32). Since then, MMF was discontinued, but methylprednisolone (20 mg once daily) and tacrolimus (1 mg twice daily, the drug concentration was maintained at 2-3 ng/ml) were maintained. He remained well as of April 2 (Day 54), with lower serum creatinine level (112 μmol/L) (Table ) and moderately improved chest CT images (Fig. d).\n",
      "Given the incomplete absorption of the lesions in the lung but nearly normal serum creatinine level (112 μmol/L), we retrospectively analyzed the patient’s sputum collected on Feb 25 for the presence of P. jirovecii by a more sensitive method. Using a laboratory-developed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay that targets the mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA gene of P. jirovecii [], we found that the levels of P. jirovecii in his sputum were almost tenfold higher than those in a PJP positive sputum (collected from a non-COVID-19 patient). This finding suggested that the patient probably suffered from PJP. Accordingly, the patient received one month of anti-PJP treatment with TMP-SMX starting on April 4 (0.96 g twice daily), resulting in a favorable outcome, including significantly improved symptoms and imaging.\n",

      "A 16-year-old girl with a history of psoriasis presented to the emergency department for fever, cough and unintentional weight loss. Her symptoms began 4 months prior to presentation with intermittent, non-productive daytime cough associated with pleuritic chest pain. She describes daily tactile fevers and chills. She has also had intermittent diffuse, ‘crampy’ abdominal pain with associated non-bloody, non-bilious emesis occurring approximately three times per week. Additionally, she described nausea and anorexia, resulting in a 15 kg weight loss over the past 4 months. She denied upper respiratory symptoms, sore throat, dysphagia, haematemesis, haemoptysis, cyanosis, diarrhoea, melena, haematochezia, dysuria, haematuria or rashes. She denied syncope, presyncope or seizures. She reported her last menstrual period as 3 months prior and denied any current vaginal symptoms. She denied recent travel, known sick contacts, sexual activity or illicit and recreational drug use. She was born in Ethiopia, moved to the USA relatively soon after birth and last travelled there 9 years ago. She had no contact with recent international travellers or prisoners.\n",
      "She reported that during the past 4 months, she had been seen at an urgent care facility multiple times and treated with three different oral antibiotics for pneumonia; she cannot recall the names of these prescriptions. She has also been seen in an outpatient gastroenterology clinic and had an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy that demonstrated oesophageal candidiasis, for which she was treated with fluconazole. She was previously healthy with the exception of psoriasis. Regarding her psoriasis, she reported that she previously had diffuse skin involvement, but has never had arthritis. She was initially treated with adalimumab, a monoclonal antibody against tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, but was changed to methotrexate after being diagnosed with pneumonia. Her psoriatic symptoms are currently well controlled. She presented to the emergency department due to lack of improvement in systemic symptoms after the above management and a new sensation of a racing heartbeat.\n",
      "In the emergency department, her initial vital signs were: temperature 39.2°C, heart rate of 140 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, blood pressure of 115/61 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 94% on room air and weight 54.6 kg. On examination, she was tired and chronically ill-appearing, but non-toxic. Her physical examination was remarkable for tachycardia without murmur, bounding radial pulses and mild respiratory distress with asymmetrically (right>left) diminished basilar aeration. She does not have lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites or peripheral oedema. The remainder of her examination was normal. Laboratory studies were remarkable for normocytic anaemia, lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated prothrombin time and elevated inflammatory markers. Electrolytes, transaminases, thyroid profile and urine pregnancy test were normal. HIV antibody and viral load were negative. Review of records shows that her outside chest X-ray was remarkable for rounded opacities scattered throughout both lungs and a right upper lobe cavitary lesion. A chest CT was obtained, which reveals a cavitary right upper lobe mass ().\n",

      "A 45-year-old woman with a 3-year history of chronic anemia was followed up at the Gastroenterology outpatient department of another hospital, with a 6-month history of abdominal pain. The pain was intermittent, worse in the mornings, and localized to the epigastric region. The patient noticed that her abdomen became distended after meals and distension was relieved after a bowel movement. The patient noticed a 12-kg weight loss over the last 6 months. There was a history of nausea but no vomiting. The patient denied any history of loss of appetite, diarrhea or constipation, and upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding. There was no significant past medical history other than anemia and multiple blood transfusions. The patient denied any history of tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, drug abuse, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, chronic renal failure, peptic ulcer disease, and chronic pancreatitis. Her family history was unremarkable. The patient did not have any prior surgeries or history of malignancy. Workup for her chronic anemia included CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast, which revealed duodenal intussusception. The patient was booked for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in the referral hospital but missed her appointment and asked for a referral to another hospital.\n",
      "Upon arrival at our hospital, she appeared underweight (height, 162 cm; weight, 43 kg). Her vitals were stable, and she was afebrile (blood pressure, 118/67 mm/Hg; heart rate, 96 bpm; respiratory rate, 23 bpm; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; temperature: 36.9 °C). On examination, her abdomen was soft and laxative, with no tenderness, or organomegaly. A complete blood count on the day of admission revealed the following: low hemoglobin level, 7.2 g/dL (12.0–17.0 g/dL); mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 78.0 fL (80.0–100.0 fL); low hematocrit, 24.8% (40.0%–51.0%); leukocyte count, 8.2 × 109/L (4.5-11.0 × 109/L); and platelet count, 323 × 109/L (150-450 × 109/L). Other laboratory profiles were unremarkable. Contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed significant dilation of the stomach with no detectable gastric lesion. The third part of the duodenum was distended by a sausage-shaped intraluminal structure with alternating fat planes and dilated vessels reaching up to the first part of the duodenum, suggesting retrograde jejuno-duodenal intussusception. There was no detectable soft tissue lesion, and the rest of the bowel was unremarkable (A–C). Endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract revealed a large, long, mobile submucosal longitudinal and tortuous bulge extending from the first to the second part of the duodenum that moved freely with bowel contraction. The papilla of Vater was normal with no neoplastic process.\n",
      "The patient underwent laparoscopic exploration, which revealed antiperistaltic intussusception in the proximal jejunum (). A jejunostomy was performed, and the mass was pulled through in the proximal jejunum (A).\n",
      "A cholecystectomy was performed, and a pediatric feeding tube was passed through the cystic duct to locate the ampulla of Vater. The mass was not resectable without affecting the ampulla, so the decision was made to perform a pancreas-sparing duodenal resection. The excised duodenum with mass was sent for histopathological examination (B).\n",
      "Pathological findings showed a large polypoid mass with the mucosa pedunculated from the bowel lumen, measuring 12 × 7.5 × 2.0 cm3. Microscopic examination revealed a bowel mucosa with underlying submucosa showing lobules of benign normal-appearing Brunner's glands separated by fibrous stroma. The nodular proliferation of Brunner glands was accompanied by cystically dilated ducts and adipose tissue with no microscopic features of malignancy (A–C). The patient was discharged postoperatively in good condition, given an appointment after 1 month.\n",

Workup for her chronic anemia included CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast, which revealed duodenal intussusception. The patient was booked for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in the referral hospital but missed her appointment and asked for a referral to another hospital.\n",
      "Upon arrival at our hospital, she appeared underweight (height, 162 cm; weight, 43 kg). Her vitals were stable, and she was afebrile (blood pressure, 118/67 mm/Hg; heart rate, 96 bpm; respiratory rate, 23 bpm; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; temperature: 36.9 °C). On examination, her abdomen was soft and laxative, with no tenderness, or organomegaly. A complete blood count on the day of admission revealed the following: low hemoglobin level, 7.2 g/dL (12.0–17.0 g/dL); mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 78.0 fL (80.0–100.0 fL); low hematocrit, 24.8% (40.0%–51.0%); leukocyte count, 8.2 × 109/L (4.5-11.0 × 109/L); and platelet count, 323 × 109/L (150-450 × 109/L). Other laboratory profiles were unremarkable. Contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed significant dilation of the stomach with no detectable gastric lesion. The third part of the duodenum was distended by a sausage-shaped intraluminal structure with alternating fat planes and dilated vessels reaching up to the first part of the duodenum, suggesting retrograde jejuno-duodenal intussusception. There was no detectable soft tissue lesion, and the rest of the bowel was unremarkable (A–C). Endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract revealed a large, long, mobile submucosal longitudinal and tortuous bulge extending from the first to the second part of the duodenum that moved freely with bowel contraction. The papilla of Vater was normal with no neoplastic process.\n",
      "The patient underwent laparoscopic exploration, which revealed antiperistaltic intussusception in the proximal jejunum (). A jejunostomy was performed, and the mass was pulled through in the proximal jejunum (A).\n",
      "A cholecystectomy was performed, and a pediatric feeding tube was passed through the cystic duct to locate the ampulla of Vater. The mass was not resectable without affecting the ampulla, so the decision was made to perform a pancreas-sparing duodenal resection. The excised duodenum with mass was sent for histopathological examination (B).\n",
      "Pathological findings showed a large polypoid mass with the mucosa pedunculated from the bowel lumen, measuring 12 × 7.5 × 2.0 cm3. Microscopic examination revealed a bowel mucosa with underlying submucosa showing lobules of benign normal-appearing Brunner's glands separated by fibrous stroma. The nodular proliferation of Brunner glands was accompanied by cystically dilated ducts and adipose tissue with no microscopic features of malignancy (A–C). The patient was discharged postoperatively in good condition, given an appointment after 1 month.\n",

The patient reported that his symptoms rapidly progressed a few hours prior to arrival shortly after smoking crystal methamphetamine. The patient reported chronic methamphetamine use for 10 years, becoming an everyday user 3 years ago. He admitted to occasional polysubstance use that included ketamine, ecstasy, and alcohol, although those were limited to a few times a month. Past medical history was significant for two remote spontaneous pneumothoraces, but the patient stated that his current symptoms felt unrelated. Past surgical history was noncontributory and he denied allergies or taking any prescribed medications. Reviews of systems were positive for myalgias and fatigue.

      "A 73-year-old female patient, who was hospitalized since 3 months, presented with complaints of paroxysmal dry cough since 2 weeks. The patient was admitted initially due to progressive dyspnea. Respiratory distress occurred 2 days later and she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) after intubation for mechanical ventilation. Her past medical history included hypertension and diabetes mellitus for approximately 20 years; both of which were in a stable condition with regular medication. Six months before admission, she underwent a median sternotomy and thymectomy for thymoma. She denied having a recent travel history aboard but reported contact with a large pigeon population as there was a large dovecot near her residence. A series of examinations were performed for the unexplained respiratory failure, and myasthenic crisis was diagnosed based on high levels of acetylcholine receptor antibodies (> 4 nmol/L) and neurophysiological study findings. Consequently, she received several courses of plasma exchange followed by a high dose of prednisolone (30 mg daily) and azathioprine (25 mg daily) to treat the myasthenic crisis. Her respiratory condition improved after the therapy. She was transferred to the general ward after successfully weaning off mechanical ventilation. Oral prednisolone and azathioprine therapy was continued. After receiving prednisolone and azathioprine therapy for nearly 3 months, she developed dry cough. Physical examination revealed that respiratory rate was 15 breaths/min, blood pressure was 140/88 mmHg, heart rate was 80 beats/min, and body temperature was in the normal range. The remainder of the examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, and other organ systems was unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation included a peripheral white blood cell count of 8870/µL; hemoglobin, 10.8 g/dL; and platelet count of 299,000/µL. Her serum alanine aminotransferase level was 9 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase level was 19 U/L; blood urea nitrogen level was 13 mg/dL; creatinine level was 0.3 mg/dL; level of procalcitonin was 0.1 ng/Ml, and level of C-reactive protein was 1.78 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis (with the patient breathing ambient air) revealed pH 7.47, PaCO2 56.9 mmHg, PaO2 66.7 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 99%.\n",
      "A thoracic CT scan was performed. On comparing it with the previous thoracic CT scan performed on admission (Fig. a), a newly developed 2-cm consolidative nodule was observed on the upper lobe of the left lung (Fig. b). Serum aspergillus galactomannan antigen testing, fungus stain and fungus culture of sputum, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of sputum for mycobacterium tuberculosis were all negative. The CT-guided biopsy was performed, and its pathology revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells engulfing thick-wall micro-organisms (Fig. a). These organisms were 4–6 microns in diameter, stains bright red with Periodic Acid Schiff (Fig. b) and black in Gomori Methenamine-Silver (Fig. c), consistent with those of cryptococcus. A subsequent serum titer of cryptococcal antigen was 1:8 using Remel Cryptococcus Antigen Test Kit (Remel, Lenexa, KS, USA). Because there were no neurologic symptoms and signs indicated cryptococcus meningoencephalitis, lumbar puncture was not performed. Immune status of the patient was then assessed. Except for recent immunosuppressive therapy for the myasthenic crisis, the patient revealed no evidence of malignancy or vasculitis, and human immunodeficiency virus testing was negative. To determine the possibility of cross transmission from infected patients, we reviewed the incidence of cryptococcal infection cases in the ICU and the general ward for up to 1 month before the patient was diagnosed, but no new cryptococcal infection cases were reported. Intravenous fluconazole, 400 mg daily, was administered for pulmonary cryptococcal infection for 14 days. Respiratory symptoms nearly resolved after treatment and the patient was discharged for outpatient follow-up with continuation of oral fluconazole 400 mg daily. The chest CT scan, 3 months after discharge, revealed complete clearance of the lesion (Fig. c) and the relevant inflammatory biomarkers were in the normal range. No recurrence of the Cryptococcal infection has occurred to date.\n",

      "A 42-year-old female was seen in the emergency department with three days of severe abdominal pain and sepsis. Medical history included menometrorrhagia due to uterine fibroids and previous endometrial ablation in 2015. She used a contraceptive vaginal ring for three months prior and Provera for 2 days prior to presentation for persistent vaginal bleeding. Physical examination revealed the following vital signs: temperature 39.2°C; blood pressure 136/78 mmHg, pulse 132 beats/min, and respiratory rate 16 breaths/min. Oxygen saturation was 100% on room air. Physical exam revealed tenderness throughout the lower abdomen with voluntary guarding. Labarotory data revealed WBC of 12,000/µL, Hgb of 7.8 gm/dL and Hct of 25.7, sodium of 127 mmol/L, and chloride of 96 mmol/L. Lactate was normal at 1.5 mmol/L. Initial CT scan showed uterine masses, consistent with known fibroids, and minimal pelvic fluid ().\n",
      "She was initially admitted to the medical service for sepsis. Given her lower abdominal pain, Gynecology was consulted for presumed pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). She was started on empiric antibiotics for PID (ceftriaxone IV 1 g every 24 hours, azithromycin IV 500 mg every 24 hours, and metronidazole IV 500 mg every 8 hours). Blood, urine, and stool cultures were sent upon admission, all of which were negative.\n",
      "Her pain continued to progress with rising leukocytosis to 20,000/µL. A repeat CT scan on hospital day four showed interval development of ascites (). Surgical consultation was obtained, and she was found to have an acute abdomen. She was taken for a diagnostic laparoscopy, which revealed a dense fibrinous exudate and significant ascites in all four quadrants of the abdomen (). Multiple peritoneal biopsies were taken, and peritoneal fluid was sent for gram stain, cultures, and cytology.\n",
      "Postoperatively, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA-125 levels were obtained. CEA was within the normal range, and CA-125 was mildly elevated at 56.8 U/mL (normal 0–35.0 U/mL). Her WBC fluctuated between 15,000 and 25,000/µL. The peritoneal fluid gram stain did not reveal any bacteria. Cytology revealed rare mesothelial cells and abundant neutrophils but no malignant cells. Final pathology report stated the presence of benign fibromembranous tissue with severe acute inflammation and extensive necrosis, consistent with “severe necrotizing acute peritonitis.”\n",
      "Given the extensive inflammatory reaction, infectious disease was consulted. Group A Strep (GAS) peritonitis was suspected, and recommendations were made to continue ceftriaxone at 1 g IV every 24 hours in addition to one dose of clindamycin 600 mg IV. Azithromycin was added to ceftriaxone three days later (IV 500 mg every 24 hours). A streptolysin O antibody (ASO) titer was sent but came back normal at 61 I U/mL (normal range 0–330 IU/mL), arguing against GAS peritonitis. Ceftriaxone was stopped, and azithromycin was transitioned to oral 500 mg daily.\n",
      "She continued to have persistent abdominal pain and anorexia. A repeat CT scan obtained nine days after surgery () showed peritoneal enhancement and several fluid collections. A diagnostic paracentesis was performed, and the peritoneal fluid was sent to an outside institution for 16S ribosome analysis, to isolate bacterial RNA.\n",
      "Her abdominal pain and leukocytosis slowly improved. She continued to have severe anorexia and food aversion, despite reassuring physical exam findings. On hospital day 23, she was discharged home on oral azithromycin. Several days after discharge, 16S ribosome testing revealed Mycoplasma hominis RNA within the peritoneal fluid.

The pneumonia diagnosis was confirmed by a chest radiograph and CT showing multifocal nodular consolidation in the right lower lobe with cavitations and blood cultures were taken that grew Staphylococcus aureus.\n",

      "A dyspneic 69-year-old male was referred for further management to our tertiary referral hospital with suspicion of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. He suffered typical chest pain, diaphoresis, and an anterior myocardial infarction 3 days before admission to our hospital and was treated with streptokinase in a general medical center. He also underwent dopamine and dobutamine therapy in that center because of a significant reduction in his blood pressure.\n",
      "On admission, he had a pulse rate of 105 bpm, a blood pressure of 80/65 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 25 (O2 saturation = 92%). On physical examination, he had muffled heart sounds and a fine crackle in the lower two-thirds of both lungs. His jugular venous pressure was higher than normal, and his electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with significant Q waves in V1 through V6 precordial leads.\n",
      "Initial transthoracic echocardiography showed a severe abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF = 20%) with a massive pericardial effusion with hemodynamic effect (right ventricular outflow tract collapse). The results were highly suggestive for rupture of the apical septal myocardium with clot formation.\n",
      "The operation was performed through a standard median sternotomy. The proximal part of pericardium was partially opened, and a controlled amount of blood was removed gradually, which immediately improved his hemodynamic indices. Standard cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was performed with mild hypothermia (32°C) and standard cardioplegic myocardial preservation. The heart was arrested, and the pericardium was opened completely. Thereafter, the remaining blood was drained. A large myocardial infarction in the apex was seen, and the sub-epicardial hematoma extended to the lateral side of left and right ventricular free wall. This resulted in intramural perforation of the apex (). The distal part of the LAD was inside the hematoma and was not suitable for graft anastomosis. Under dry conditions, a 95 × 48 mm piece of TachoSil® patch was positioned on the area and was pressed to the surface of the ventricle for 5 minutes. This was repeated two times after which no bleeding was observed. Thereafter, a large autologous pericardial patch was fixed over the surface covered by TachoSil® fleece far from fragile necrotic tissue with a few separate 6 - 0 Prolene sutures to obtain maximal adhesion to the epicardial surface. Finally, a generous Teflon felt patch was sewn over all previous patches to reinforce adhesion and avoid blood oozing (). The aortic cross-clamp was released, and the patient was weaned from CPB after normothermia with normal sinus rhythm, epinephrine, and insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump. The CPB and aortic cross-clamp times were 112 and 47 minutes, respectively. No bleeding occurred during the follow-up period.\n",
      "The patient was alive and had a good clinical status 12 months later. Postoperative and follow-up transesophageal echocardiography showed normal left and right ventricular size (LVEF of 30% - 35%) without pseudo-aneurysm. All apical, inferoseptal, and anteroseptal segments showed akinesia. Echocardiography also revealed anterior hypokinesia. There was no ventricular septal defect.

      "On admission, he had a pulse rate of 105 bpm, a blood pressure of 80/65 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 25 (O2 saturation = 92%). On physical examination, he had muffled heart sounds and a fine crackle in the lower two-thirds of both lungs. His jugular venous pressure was higher than normal, and his electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with significant Q waves in V1 through V6 precordial leads.\n",
      "Initial transthoracic echocardiography showed a severe abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF = 20%) with a massive pericardial effusion with hemodynamic effect (right ventricular outflow tract collapse). The results were highly suggestive for rupture of the apical septal myocardium with clot formation.\n",
      "The operation was performed through a standard median sternotomy. The proximal part of pericardium was partially opened, and a controlled amount of blood was removed gradually, which immediately improved his hemodynamic indices. Standard cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was performed with mild hypothermia (32°C) and standard cardioplegic myocardial preservation. The heart was arrested, and the pericardium was opened completely. Thereafter, the remaining blood was drained. A large myocardial infarction in the apex was seen, and the sub-epicardial hematoma extended to the lateral side of left and right ventricular free wall. This resulted in intramural perforation of the apex (). The distal part of the LAD was inside the hematoma and was not suitable for graft anastomosis. Under dry conditions, a 95 × 48 mm piece of TachoSil® patch was positioned on the area and was pressed to the surface of the ventricle for 5 minutes. This was repeated two times after which no bleeding was observed. Thereafter, a large autologous pericardial patch was fixed over the surface covered by TachoSil® fleece far from fragile necrotic tissue with a few separate 6 - 0 Prolene sutures to obtain maximal adhesion to the epicardial surface. Finally, a generous Teflon felt patch was sewn over all previous patches to reinforce adhesion and avoid blood oozing (). The aortic cross-clamp was released, and the patient was weaned from CPB after normothermia with normal sinus rhythm, epinephrine, and insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump. The CPB and aortic cross-clamp times were 112 and 47 minutes, respectively. No bleeding occurred during the follow-up period.\n",
      "The patient was alive and had a good clinical status 12 months later. Postoperative and follow-up transesophageal echocardiography showed normal left and right ventricular size (LVEF of 30% - 35%) without pseudo-aneurysm. All apical, inferoseptal, and anteroseptal segments showed akinesia. Echocardiography also revealed anterior hypokinesia. There was no ventricular septal defect. The pericardium was normal without any effusion.\n",

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A previously healthy 50-year-old intoxicated man was driving on a road on a May afternoon when he attempted to move a snake off the road with a stick to prevent it from being run over. He was bitten on the dorsum of his right hand by a positively identified 6-foot long diamondback rattlesnake (). He immediately called his wife who called emergency medical services (EMS) while he drove home. When EMS arrived, he was found to be confused, nauseated, and vomiting, with altered mental status and intermittent combativeness. Once in the transport vehicle, an intravenous line was established and he was given 25 mg of intravenous (IV) diphenhydramine.\n",
      "Upon arrival in the emergency department (ED) less than one hour after the initial injury, the patient was noted to be tachycardic (HR 131), hypotensive (92/79), and stridorous. On physical examination, he had decreased mental status, voice change, and significant perioral, pharyngeal, and marked glossal edema. Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) was initiated due to impending complete upper airway obstruction. The patient was pretreated with 100 mcg of phenylephrine IV to prevent hemodynamic decompensation during RSI. During video-assisted laryngoscopy, pronounced epiglottal and cord edema was noticed, and multiple attempts of passing a styletted endotracheal tube and gum elastic bougie failed. Bag valve mask ventilation was difficult despite use of an oral airway with a decline in his oxygen saturation to 78%. Thus the decision was made to proceed with emergency cricothyrotomy using a bougie-assisted landmark-guided technique, which was successful on its first attempt. A cuffed 6-0 endotracheal tube was passed over the bougie, with good chest rise and end-tidal capnography. At the time of securing the airway, the patient's oxygen saturation had returned to 100% secondary to continued uninterrupted two-person oral airway assisted bag valve mask ventilation.\n",
      "Initial arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.03, pCO2 of 56.1 mmHg, and pO2 of 174.0 mmHg on 60% FiO2. He received 125 mg IV methylprednisolone and 1 L Plasma-Lyte A with improvement of his blood pressure to 119/76.\n",
      "His right upper extremity was noted to have fang marks 2.5 cm apart in the first dorsal webspace (). There was severe amount of edema over the palmar and dorsal surface of the right hand extending proximally to the wrist with mottling and ecchymoses of the right hand. The compartments remained compressible, capillary refill remained brisk, and oxygen saturation remained 95–99% SpO2 in all five fingers. Orthopedic surgery was consulted by the emergency physicians for the evaluation of progressive swelling and potential compartment syndrome; no surgical intervention was performed as the patient maintained a radial pulse by Doppler signal and brisk capillary refill.\n",
      "The state's poison center was simultaneously consulted in the ED; an initial bolus of 6 vials of FabAV (CroFab) was administered. Initial pre-FabAV laboratory findings from the emergency department demonstrated consumptive coagulopathy: thrombocytopenia (platelets 20 × 103 mm−3), d-dimer > 20 μg mL−1, fibrinogen < 35 mg dL−1, INR > 8, PTT > 240 sec, and PT > 150 sec. The patient was subsequently admitted to the medical intensive care unit for further management.\n",
      "The state's poison control recommended boluses of CroFab per their protocol, which initially corrected his coagulopathy. His coagulation panel at the time of administration of FabAV throughout his hospitalization is shown in . The first week of his hospitalization was uneventful. The edema of his right upper extremity stabilized within 24 hours and did not require surgical intervention. He was successfully extubated on day 5.\n",
      "On day 8 of his hospitalization, his fibrinogen and platelet count trended downwards, and his PT and INR trended upwards. He remained hemodynamically stable with no drop in his blood pressure, hemoglobin, or hematocrit and did not exhibit signs or symptoms of bleeding from his coagulopathy. There was no recurrence of swelling. Hematology was consulted, and decision was made to start him on FabAV infusions each over 6 hours instead of 1 hour. After six vials of FabAV were infused over 6 hours each, his coagulopathy resolved. The resolution of his coagulopathy is demonstrated in . His coagulopathy resolved by day 12 and he was subsequently discharged from the hospital.\n",

      "A previously healthy 75-yr-old Korean woman was hospitalized with a 7-day history of exertional dyspnea and fever on August 16, 2011. She had not raised any pet dogs or cats. On admission, her vital signs showed body temperature 38.3℃, blood pressure 147/63 mmHg, heart rate 86/min, and respiratory rate 18/min. On physical examination, a grade 3 diastolic heart murmur was detected at left upper sternal border. Her complete blood count showed WBC 7,910/µL (neutrophils 90.8%, lymphocytes 7.5%), hemoglobin 12.7 g/dL and platelet 71,000/µL. Chemistry profiles showed total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, AST 16 IU/L, ALT 4 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 79 IU/L, total protein 6.1 g/dL and albumin 2.8 g/dL. BUN 17.1 mg/dL, creatinine 0.87 mg/dL and CRP 1.4 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.537, pO2 65.9 mmHg, pCO2 31.3 mmHg, O2 saturation 92.2%, and HCO3 26 mM. Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria and microalbuminuria. A chest radiograph and electrocardiogram showed no abnormality. Echocardiography demonstrated the presence of oscillating vegetation (0.46 × 1.77 cm) attached to the aortic valve, as well as moderate aortic regurgitation. Ceftriaxone was empirically given in a dose of 2 g/day after repeated blood cultures. On hospital day 2, she underwent urgent valve replacement surgery due to the risk of embolization. Intraoperative findings revealed 0.5 × 1.5 cm sized oscillating mass on left coronary cusp. Blood cultures obtained prior to antibiotic administration were all negative. Microbiological examination of the excised aortic valve and vegetation revealed no organism on the Gram stain and the culture grew no organism. Histology revealed fibromyxoid valvulopathy and chronic active inflammation with vegetation, which were consistent with infective endocarditis. Empirical ceftriaxone treatment was continued under the diagnosis of culture-negative endocarditis.\n",
      "Bacterial DNA was extracted from surgically excised valve tissue and vegetation, directly. A 16S rRNA fragment was amplified with the universal primers 4F (5'-TTGGAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCT-3'), 534R (5'-TACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-3'), 27F (5'-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3'), and 801R (5'-GGCGTGGACTTCCAGGGTATCT-3').\n",
      "The 16S rRNA gene sequence showed 100% (707/707) similarity to that of the Bartonella quintana strain (accession no. BX897700 and AJ250247) in the GenBank database (). The next closest sequences were those of Bartonella henselae, and it showed 98.7% (699/708) similarity (accession no. DQ645426 and BX897699). Identification to the Bartonella species can be accepted if there is a ≥ 99% match with the 16S rRNA gene sequence and a difference of greater than 0.8% between those of other different species, according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline MM18-A (). B. quintana was also only the best-matched strain in the BIBI database (). Based on the molecular identification using GenBank and BIBI databases, we concluded that B. quintana was the best matched species.\n",
      "In addition, serologic testing with the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) method, which was performed at the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed an IgG titer of 1:512 to Bartonella spp. After she was finally diagnosed with B. quintana endocarditis, gentamicin was added to ceftriaxone in a dose of 1.7 mg/kg q8h. She was discharged after ceftriaxone treatment for 4 weeks in combination with gentamicin for the last 2 weeks.\n",

      "The patient was a 32-year-old female, mother of a 13-month-old boy who was directly breastfed since birth with complementary food added at 6 months of age. On January 20, 2020, the patient and her son had a family meal with relatives who returned to Yiwu from Wuhan for the Spring Festival. Two weeks later the patient had nasal congestion, and her son had a fever with a peak temperature of 38.4 °C, dry cough, and nasal congestion. Two days after the onset (February 2, 2020), tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid performed at the Fourth Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, were positive in both the mother and the son, whereas the patient’s husband had a negative result. The results were confirmed by the Yiwu Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The patient suffered from postpartum depression, felt deeply anxious, and insisted on staying with her child. At the same time, the husband asked to accompany his wife and son due to concerns about the patient’s mental health. To respect the wish of the patient and her family, and after consultation with psychiatrists, the family was treated in the same negative-pressure isolation ward room.\n",
      "On admission, the mother had nasal congestion, but no rhinorrhea, cough, sputum, fever, or fatigue. The physical examination revealed a body temperature of 36.4 °C, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, a pulse of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 102/74 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% while breathing ambient air. Lung auscultation indicated no abnormalities. The results of a routine blood tests (complete blood count, liver and renal function), C-reactive protein and chest Xray were normal. Respiratory virus antigen quadruplet test (Influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus) and the nucleic acid test for Influenza A and B virus were negative. The patient received atomized inhalation of recombinant human interferon α-2b 5 million International Unit (IU) in 2 mL sterilized water twice a day as the antiviral treatment from hospital day one to day 28 and traditional Chinese medicine as a supplemental therapy from hospital day four to day 28. She continued directly breastfeeding four to five times every day. The symptom of nasal congestion improved on hospital day 2, and white blood cell count declined to 2.7 × 109/L, while the lymphocyte count was 0.9 × 109/L. The nasopharyngeal swab specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but the serum was negative. On hospital day 3, the symptoms of nasal congestion disappeared, not to return. The mother’s body temperature and oxygen saturation without oxygen inhalation were monitored and remained within the normal range, and the patient was in stable condition. On hospital day 4, the plain chest CT scan indicated the presence of density-increased patchy consolidation and ground-glass shadow in the lower lobe of the right lung, and viral pneumonia was the likely diagnosis (Fig. a). Subsequently, on hospital day 10, white blood cell and lymphocyte counts returned to a normal level, and liver and renal function and myocardial enzyme tests continued to be normal. During the period of hospitalization, the mother’s serum, milk and feces specimens tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but the nasopharyngeal swabs were repeatedly positive. Chest CT scans on hospital days 10 and 23 showed the gradual clearing of the lungs. (Fig. b, c). On hospital days 9 and 25 after admission, the breastmilk tests yielded a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and negative for IgM. Similarly, the maternal serum was positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and negative for IgM on hospital days 16 and 20. On hospital day 28, the patient was discharged as three consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for SARS- CoV-2 nucleic acid. The major laboratory results of the patient are listed in Table .\n",
      "The patient’s 13-month-old son had a fever, occasional dry cough, and nasal congestion at admission to the hospital. The physical examination revealed a body temperature of 37.6 °C, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, a pulse of 105 beats per minute, blood pressure of 95/56 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 99% while breathing ambient air, and bodyweight of 10 kg. There was no abnormality in lung auscultation. During the hospitalization, antiviral treatment with atomized inhalation of recombinant human interferon α-2b 1.5 million International Unit (IU) in 2 mL sterilized water was performed twice a day for 8 days, from day 1 to day 8 of hospitalization. On the day of admission, the white blood cell count was low at 3.7 × 109/L, and lymphocyte count was 2 × 109/L. The infant’s serum tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. On hospital day 2, the temperature returned to the normal value, and remained normal thereafter, but occasional dry cough and runny nose continued. On hospital day 4, feces and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, and plain chest CT scan revealed ground-glass shadows in the lower lobe of the right lung (Fig. a). On hospital day 6, the child’s cough was essentially resolved, while occasional rhinorrhea persisted. At that time, the counts of white blood cells and lymphocytes were 6.9 × 109/L and 5.1 × 109/L, respectively. The child became free of symptoms on hospital day 7. On hospital day 14, the serum was negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. Nasopharyngeal swabs and feces specimens repeatedly tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. On hospital day 28, when the child tested negatively two consecutive times for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swabs and chest CT indicated that the ground-glass shadows in the lungs were essentially absorbed (Fig. b), the child was discharged.

      "A 71-year-old African American male presented for routine follow-up with his primary care physician 3 months after initiating atorvastatin 80 mg and pioglitazone 15 mg daily. His lipid panel revealed a total cholesterol of 152 mg/dL, triglycerides of 83 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 59 mg/dL, and a calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) of 76 mg/dL. LFTs were notable for an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 1093 U/L (upper limit of normal [ULN] 41 U/L), an alanine transaminase (ALT) of 1385 U/L (ULN 58 U/L), and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 265 U/L (ULN 129 U/L; R Factor 11.6; ). Total bilirubin was elevated to 1.5 mg/dL (ULN 1.2 mg/dL). The patient denied myalgias, pruritus, or abdominal pain. He was admitted for further management.\n",
      "The patient denied known hypotensive episodes or recent use of alcohol, herbal supplements, antibiotics, or acetaminophen. Gamma glutamyl-transferase was elevated to 551 U/L (ULN 50 U/L). Serum acetaminophen and ethanol were undetectable. Hepatitis A virus IgM/IgG, hepatitis B virus core IgM/IgG, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) antibodies were negative, as were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HIV-1 and HCV RNA. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic, anti-mitochondrial, and liver-kidney microsome antibodies were not detected. Serum IgG, copper, and ceruloplasmin levels were normal. Remaining workup was unrevealing except for a borderline-positive smooth muscle antibody titer of 1:20 (normal <1:20) and a ferritin of 1469 ng/mL (ULN 336 ng/mL). Serum albumin (3.4 g/dL) and prothrombin time international normalized ratio (1.01) were within normal limits. Liver ultrasound revealed “mildly increased echogenicity, coarsened echotexture, and attenuation of sound beam” suggestive of “hepatic steatosis and/or diffuse hepatocellular disease.” The right lobe measured 14.1 cm. A prior abdominal computerized tomography scan with contrast at age 60 years revealed only a punctate calcification, likely a granuloma, within the right lobe.\n",
      "On admission, his temperature was 36.8 °C, heart rate was 67 beats per minute, blood pressure was 123/63 mm Hg, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. Physical examination revealed no scleral icterus, a soft and nontender abdomen without palpable masses or organomegaly, and normal mental status. Atorvastatin and pioglitazone were discontinued on admission with rapid improvement in LFTs (see ). Liver biopsy was therefore not performed. The patient remained asymptomatic and was discharged on hospital day 4 with normalization of LFTs within 1 month. Simvastatin 20 mg daily and pioglitazone 15 mg daily were started 3 and 10 months after discharge, respectively. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen at 3 months again showed a likely granuloma but no steatosis. Serum LFTs have since remained within normal limits.\n",
      "Before starting atorvastatin, the patient had been taking simvastatin 40 mg daily for 11 years for an elevated LDL-c of 137 mg/dL and a 10-year ASCVD risk of 18.9%. Other pertinent medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and stage 2 chronic kidney disease. He had no history of ASCVD. His baseline serum LFTs were within normal limits. No change in LFTs or other side effects were noted while on simvastatin. His LDL-c reached a nadir of 74 mg/dL at age 70 years.\n",
      "Three months prior to this presentation, the patient’s LDL-c was elevated to 93 mg/dL, at which point simvastatin was stopped and atorvastatin 80 mg daily was started. A goal LDL-c below 70 mg/dL was targeted for secondary prevention out of concern for prior ischemic stroke resulting in bilateral superior altitudinal hemianopsia noted on visual field testing 6 months prior.

      "A 71-year-old African American male presented for routine follow-up with his primary care physician 3 months after initiating atorvastatin 80 mg and pioglitazone 15 mg daily. His lipid panel revealed a total cholesterol of 152 mg/dL, triglycerides of 83 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 59 mg/dL, and a calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) of 76 mg/dL. LFTs were notable for an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 1093 U/L (upper limit of normal [ULN] 41 U/L), an alanine transaminase (ALT) of 1385 U/L (ULN 58 U/L), and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 265 U/L (ULN 129 U/L; R Factor 11.6; ). Total bilirubin was elevated to 1.5 mg/dL (ULN 1.2 mg/dL). The patient denied myalgias, pruritus, or abdominal pain. He was admitted for further management.\n",
      "The patient denied known hypotensive episodes or recent use of alcohol, herbal supplements, antibiotics, or acetaminophen. Gamma glutamyl-transferase was elevated to 551 U/L (ULN 50 U/L). Serum acetaminophen and ethanol were undetectable. Hepatitis A virus IgM/IgG, hepatitis B virus core IgM/IgG, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) antibodies were negative, as were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HIV-1 and HCV RNA. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic, anti-mitochondrial, and liver-kidney microsome antibodies were not detected. Serum IgG, copper, and ceruloplasmin levels were normal. Remaining workup was unrevealing except for a borderline-positive smooth muscle antibody titer of 1:20 (normal <1:20) and a ferritin of 1469 ng/mL (ULN 336 ng/mL). Serum albumin (3.4 g/dL) and prothrombin time international normalized ratio (1.01) were within normal limits. Liver ultrasound revealed “mildly increased echogenicity, coarsened echotexture, and attenuation of sound beam” suggestive of “hepatic steatosis and/or diffuse hepatocellular disease.” The right lobe measured 14.1 cm. A prior abdominal computerized tomography scan with contrast at age 60 years revealed only a punctate calcification, likely a granuloma, within the right lobe.\n",
      "On admission, his temperature was 36.8 °C, heart rate was 67 beats per minute, blood pressure was 123/63 mm Hg, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. Physical examination revealed no scleral icterus, a soft and nontender abdomen without palpable masses or organomegaly, and normal mental status. Atorvastatin and pioglitazone were discontinued on admission with rapid improvement in LFTs (see ). Liver biopsy was therefore not performed. The patient remained asymptomatic and was discharged on hospital day 4 with normalization of LFTs within 1 month. Simvastatin 20 mg daily and pioglitazone 15 mg daily were started 3 and 10 months after discharge, respectively. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen at 3 months again showed a likely granuloma but no steatosis. Serum LFTs have since remained within normal limits.\n",
      "Before starting atorvastatin, the patient had been taking simvastatin 40 mg daily for 11 years for an elevated LDL-c of 137 mg/dL and a 10-year ASCVD risk of 18.9%. Other pertinent medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and stage 2 chronic kidney disease. He had no history of ASCVD. His baseline serum LFTs were within normal limits. No change in LFTs or other side effects were noted while on simvastatin. His LDL-c reached a nadir of 74 mg/dL at age 70 years.\n",
      "Three months prior to this presentation, the patient’s LDL-c was elevated to 93 mg/dL, at which point simvastatin was stopped and atorvastatin 80 mg daily was started. A goal LDL-c below 70 mg/dL was targeted for secondary prevention out of concern for prior ischemic stroke resulting in bilateral superior altitudinal hemianopsia noted on visual field testing 6 months prior. Pioglitazone 15 mg daily was started simultaneously with atorvastatin for an elevated hemoglobin A1c of 8.1%. He was continued on his other medications, including gabapentin 300 mg 3 times daily for diabetic neuropathy, glipizide 20 mg twice daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, metformin 1000 mg twice daily, omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, paroxetine 20 mg daily, and trazodone 100 mg as needed. Subsequent review of medication history revealed that he had not refilled his simvastatin for almost 6 weeks before starting on atorvastatin.\n",

      "A 28-year-old man was admitted in our hospital on Jul 13, 2018 because of recurrent cough and yellow-phlegm accompanied by fever for more than 10 months. The symptoms were repeated after routine symptomatic treatment. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan taken in January 2018 had showed that his right lung was spotted by small piece of shadow, accompanied by a cavity. The patient refused to initiate antitubercular therapy. The symptoms were improved after self-administration of cephalosporin as anti-infection treatment for 1 week. In May, the cough and sputum were aggravated, accompanied by fever in the afternoon, with body temperature around 38 °C. In the beginning of July, chest CT showed that the patchy shadow was scattered in two lungs with multiple cavities. The large consolidation in the right upper lung was significantly progressed compared with half a year ago. Considering combination of pulmonary tuberculosis and pulmonary infection, he was hospitalized.\n",
      "At admission, physical examination revealed the following: weight 53 kg; BMI 16.7, body temperature 38.7 °C, pulse 85/min, blood pressure 118/72 mmHg, finger oxygen saturation degree (FOSD) 98%. The lungs had lower breath sounds, with no obvious dry or wet rale. The auxiliary examination showed that the following test items were normal, including blood routine, biochemistry, coagulation, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, arterial blood gas analysis and echocardiography. D-dimer was 13.17 mg/L. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. The details of chest CT was shown in Fig. . Acid-fast bacilli staining test for sputum sample was positive (4+/3+), which confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.\n",
      "Routine anti-tuberculosis regimen was initiated, including isoniazid (300 mg/day), rifampin (450 mg/day), pyrazinamide (1500 mg/day) and ethambutol (750 mg/day). After 3 days of treatment, the body temperature dropped down to the normal, and the cough was relieved. Respiratory symptoms were also improved after 15 days of treatment. At that time, the patient suddenly felt chest tightness, chest pain, and shortness of breath after increased activity (three times more than the usual). Physical examination revealed: heart beats 138/m, blood pressure 88/58 mmHg, FOSD 86%. Even after 6 L high-flow oxygen intake, FOSD was maintained at 90%. Arterial blood gas analysis without oxygen inhalation indicated: pH 7.44, PO2 48 mmHg, PCO2 33 mmHg, SPO2 86%, Oxygenation Index 228.57 mmHg, D-dimer 14.03 mg/L. Electrocardiogram showed atrial tachycardia, non-specific ST elevation. Taking together, all the data highly suggested PTE. Emergency computer tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) inspection showed signs of filling defects in the trunk and branches of the left pulmonary artery and the right lower pulmonary artery (Fig. ).\n",
      "According to the CTPA result, the patient was diagnosed as a large-scale PTE, and the risk stratification was medium-high. The patient was prescribed with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (0.1 mL/10 kg) for anticoagulation. Then, under pulmonary angiography, a combined thrombolytic therapy including mechanical thrombolysis, aspiration, and topical urokinase (300,000 U) was applied to the left pulmonary artery. Fortunately, as shown in Fig. , the filling defect of left pulmonary artery disappeared. After the interventional therapy, the patient received intravenous pumping of 20,000 U urokinase every 1 h for 24 h. The symptoms of chest tightness, chest pain and shortness of breath were significantly improved, while the blood oxygen saturation and blood pressure returned to normal, and the vital signs were stable. Neither hemoptysis nor gastrointestinal bleeding occurred during the period of thrombolysis. The deep vein B-ultrasound of double lower limbs was performed and found a flocculent echo in the superior cavity of the upper right femoral vein, and extended into the external iliac vein. Then protein C, protein S activity, coagulation factor V leiden mutation, prothrombin 20210A, lupus anticoagulant, homocysteine, were determined and no abnormality was found. Anti-tuberculosis and warfarin anticoagulant therapy were continued, and international normalized ratio (INR) value was monitored and adjusted between 2 and 3. The patient was discharged with self-administration of oral anti-TB drugs and anticoagulant drug. At follow-up after 20 days of discharge, B-ultrasound showed that the deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of right lower extremity of the patient disappeared. At follow-up of 4 months, the patient was re-examined with chest enhanced CT in the outpatient department of our hospital and no obvious emboli was found.\n",

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 35-year-old female presented to the emergency department via ambulance with a chief complaint of chest pain and dyspnea for two hours, described as constant in nature and sudden in onset. She could identify no precipitating events and was resting in bed when it started. The patient complained of severe pain in the back of her neck and left arm, which worsened with inhalation. She found nothing to relieve the symptoms and denied fever, chills, productive cough, leg pain, and lower extremity swelling.\n",
      "Her medical history included coronary artery disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, deep vein thrombosis, dyslipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux, headaches, and hypertension. Her surgical history was significant for three-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. Her medications and allergies were reviewed but not pertinent. The patient used caffeine daily and denied having ever used alcohol or recreational drugs. She reported on her last primary care visit to be a former smoker. Initial examination revealed tachycardia at 126 beats per minute, 18 labored respirations per minute, temperature of 98°F and blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, and was 97% on 2 liters (L) of oxygen. Emergency medical services initiated their chest pain protocol as well as oxygen but did not obtain room air saturation. The patient was noted to be awake, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time, with an anxious affect. Head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat exam was unremarkable. Respiratory exam showed increased work of breathing with moderate distress, but no adventitious lung sounds. Cardiac auscultation revealed a regular rhythm, without murmur, rub, or gallop. Abdominal exam was notable for obesity but non-tender. Lower extremity exam revealed no edema or calf pain.\n",
      "The patient was treated with aspirin, hydromorphone, ondansetron, diphenhydramine for itching, 2L per minute oxygen via nasal cannula, and 1L of normal saline bolus followed by 100 ml/hr continuous infusion. She was placed in the clinical decision unit and an extensive investigation was undertaken. Acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary emboli, and pneumonia led the differential diagnoses. The patient received a repeat dose of hydromorphone due to sustained pain. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia normal axis and nonspecific t-wave changes similar to prior. She was found to have an unchanged chest radiograph compared to two years prior with hyperlucent lungs, sternotomy wires, and vascular clips. Specifically, no pneumothorax, consolidations, vascular redistribution patterns, or pleural fluid were identified. She had a normal complete blood count, procalcitonin, creatine kinase, and troponin. A measured glucose of 667 mg/dL with pseudohyponatremia 128mmol/L, chloride of 96 mmol/L, and her D-Dimer was noted to be slightly elevated. She received eight units of subcutaneous insulin and a second liter of normal saline.\n",
      "A computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest was ordered to rule out pulmonary emboli. Before receiving the CT, the patient experienced a brief oxygen desaturation to 83% and was subsequently placed on a 5L per minute high-flow oxygen mask. During the CT, she was slightly confused and refused to lie flat. She then experienced several episodes of desaturation and at that point was requiring 12L per minute on a high-flow oxygen mask to maintain 90% saturation by pulse oximetry. After completing the CT, the patient had an arterial blood gas performed to clarify the extent of her hypoxia. Her pH was 7.42, PaCO2 36 mmHg, PaO2 50 mmHg, and HCO3 23 mEq/L. methemoglobin was 0.4% and carboxyhemoglobin was 1.1%. Arterial lactate was 2.4 mmol/L. Biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) support was initiated in an attempt to supplement the patient’s respiratory efforts and prevent intubation.\n",
      "The CT was reported with nodular infiltrates centered in the lower lung zones () with some confluence at the lung bases not previously seen on chest radiograph. Mediastinal adenopathy not previously seen on CT from two years prior and a nodular thickening of the hila were also noted. In addition, there was a 1.5 × 1.5 cm collection of hypodense fluid and loss of distinction in the cortex of the right kidney suggestive of trauma.\n",
      "A broader history was elicited from the patient and husband to discern a possible infectious or inflammatory etiology of the observed lower respiratory pneumonitis/inhalational injury pattern. The patient and her spouse denied trauma, fever, “huffing” paint, methamphetamine use or production, bonfires, and open fires at home. The husband interjected with commentary on the patient’s heavy use of ENDS. The patient admitted to daily use of two refill containers she knew to be 2.5%/ml or 25mg/ml in nicotine concentration, which she believed was equal to a pack of cigarettes. The husband was unable to identify the single refill product that was the most recently used at home, and the patient had three different ENDS.\n",
      "The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and upon arrival she was noted to have extensive rales, with notable work of breathing that caused truncated speech. The patient tolerated the BIPAP well, but became increasingly dyspneic despite pressure support from the BIPAP. Her increased work of breathing and impending respiratory failure urged endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. A bronchoscopy was performed that demonstrated erythema of the tracheal tissues extending to the carina that appeared cobblestoned and/or leathery. The main bronchi had a yellow, vesicular appearance with interspersed erythema and increased friability of the tissue. The right mainstem bronchus and remaining airways had a rust-colored appearance along with erythema extending into the visible lower airways (). The pattern was postulated to be inhalational injury by pulmonary medicine.\n",
      "Upon ICU admission the patient was treated empirically for bacterial pneumonia with meropenem levofloxacin and vancomycin. The right lower lobe bronchial alveolar lavage culture resulted in heavy growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureas (MRSA) 48 hours after admission. Her urine culture was positive for Escherichia coli.\n",
      "The patient continued to decline over the next 48 hours. She was transferred to a tertiary care center for possible ECMO, burn expertise, and continued intensive care.\n",
      "Upon arrival to the tertiary care center, she was persistently hypoxemic and failed a trial of mechanical ventilation with inhaled epoprostenol. Repeat bronchoscopy was performed showing persistent vesicular injury pattern (). She underwent emergent placement of veno-venous ECMO. She was stabilized and subsequent examinations showed a left hemiparesis. The neurologic insult was diffuse on magnetic resonance imaging and read as hypoxic, toxic and or metabolic insult. She improved on ECMO, eventually receiving a tracheostomy, which was decannulated 14 days later. She was returned to the long-term rehabilitation unit at the initial treatment center. There she progressed well, where she was ambulating with an assist device and made significant progress toward an independent return to home.\n",

      "A 25-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with nonresolving pneumonia. The patient had felt well until two weeks before her admission, when she began to experience a dry cough, dyspnea and pleuritic pain. Her respiratory symptoms did not respond to a 5-day course of oral cephalosporin, and macrolide antibiotics had been prescribed before her admission. She was a non-smoker with unremarkable past medical history.\n",
      "On admission the body temperature was 36.6℃, the heart rate was 84/min, the respiration rate was 20/minute and the blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg. On physical examination, the patient was alert and not in great discomfort. There was a crackle sound over the left lower lung zone. There was no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Detailed examination of the cardiovascular system and abdomen was unremarkable. Chest radiography disclosed a pneumonic infiltration on the left lower lung field and there was no cardiomegaly (). Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the chest revealed a consolidation with air-bronchogram in the left lower lobe and a small amount of pleural effusion (). The complete blood count showed a normal white cell count (8.4×109/L). There was no hypoxemia on the blood gas analysis (pH 7.4, PaCO2 37.2 mmHg, SaO2 98%) when she was breathing room air. The other laboratory investigations showed normal electrolytes and renal and liver function tests. The fasting glucose was normal. The serum anti-HIV antibody was negative. The serum immunoglobulin levels (including IgG, IgA and IgM) were normal. Pulmonary function testing showed a mild restrictive pattern (the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) was 2.50/2.32L; the ratio was 93%), and there was a normal diffusion coefficient for carbon monoxide (DLco: 109%). The initial examination of the sputum for acid-fast bacilli with gram staining and culture did not reveal any organisms. The blood culture was sterile after 7 days incubation. We then conducted a bronchoscopic examination. There were no endobronchial abnormalities. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed the lymphodominant nature (a lymphocyte count of 70%, the macrophages were 28%). The BAL fluid culture was negative and there were neither acid-fast bacilli nor any pathogens.\n",
      "During the first six days of this patient's admission to our hospital, her annoying respiratory symptoms and lung consolidation did not improved for all the combination antibiotic treatment (intravenous cefuroxime and oral clarithromycin). We performed a subsequent computed tomography guided percutaneous needle biopsy on the sixth hospital day. The tissue pathology revealed granulomatous lesion including multinucleated giant cells and fungal spores. The specimens were stained with Hematoxilin-Eosin, mucicarmine, Gomori-Methenamine silver (GMS), and periodic-acid-Schiff (PAS). The Hematoxilin-Eosin and GMS stain showed granulomatous inflammation with numerous yeast-like organisms that were surrounded by clear halos, and these organisms were present within multinucleated giant cells and in the intercellular spaces (). Mucicarmine staining for capsular material was negative. With performing additional Fontana-Masson silver staining (FMS), the black color in the walls of the organism was disclosed (). This special stain pattern is a characteristic of C. neoformans, and especially for the capsule deficient form. Subsequently, the antibiotic regimen was replaced by 1-week of once-a-day intravenous fluconazole treatment and the patient was discharged on oral fluconazole. Further cultures of the lung specimen yielded moderate growth of Cryptococcus neoformans afterward. During the 6-months follow up period her respiratory symptoms and abnormal radiologic feature were markedly improved ().\n",

      "A 15-year-old female presented in preanesthetic checkup clinic for rush nail removal of femur. She was a known case of OI type I and history of recurrent fractures for which she had been operated three times uneventfully under general anesthesia. There was no history of OI in the family.\n",
      "On general examination, she was short statured with a height of 103 cm, weighing 49 kg, blue sclera, fragile bones, progressive hearing loss, kyphoscoliosis. Her blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, and heart rate was 80 beats/min. There was no pallor, icterus, cyanosis, clubbing, lymphadenopathy, or pedal edema. Respiratory system revealed barrel-shaped chest with bilateral equal air entry, and cardiovascular system revealed normal heart sounds. Electrocardiogram (ECG), liver function test, renal function test, and coagulation profile were normal. Chest X-ray was normal except mediastinal widening; X-ray of the spine revealed dorsolumbar kyphoscoliosis to the left. Pulmonary function test was suggestive of mildly restrictive disease. Airway assessment showed acceptable flexion and extension at neck with adequate mouth opening and normal dentition, Mallampatti Class III. The patient was accepted for surgery as American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade III; in view odontoaxial dislocation and normal coagulation profile, we decided to proceed with a spinal anesthetic technique. Thorough operating room preparation was completed including difficult airway equipment, and measures made ready to deal with hyperthermias if any.\n",

      "The patient was positioned very carefully on the operation table, and pressure points were padded adequately. An 18-gauge intravenous (i.v.) cannula was inserted on the dorsum of the right hand. Monitors including ECG, sphygmomanometer, and SpO2 were placed on the patient.\n",
      "Her baseline blood pressure was 128/80 mmHg, heart rate was 90 beats/min, and O2 saturation on room air was 98%. An i.v. preload of 500 ml Ringer's lactate was administered. Despite the kyphoscoliosis, no difficulty was experienced in finding the subarachnoid space, and spinal anesthesia was given in the sitting position in the space L3–L4 space with 25-gauge Quincke needle with 2.5 ml of bupivacaine heavy 0.5%. The motor block was up to T 10 level. The operation lasted for 1 h and 45 min. There was no significant variation in the vitals, and the recovery was uneventful.\n",

      "A 46 years old female with a history of unspecified arthritis presented to the emergency department with complaints of substernal chest pain and right leg numbness of one-hour duration. The chest pain was radiating to the left shoulder and was associated with diaphoresis and dyspnea. On examination, vitals revealed a blood pressure of 92/69 mmHg, heart rate of 54/min, oxygen saturation of 100% on room air, and afebrile at 98.3°F. There was a soft systolic murmur in the right upper sternal border. Pulsation on dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery and sensation on right lower extremity was decreased. Electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed complete heart block with junctional escape rhythm and ST elevation in anterior precordial leads with ST depression in leads I and aVL (Figure ). Pertinent labs revealed initial troponin-I of 0.05 ng/ml. The remaining blood work, including complete blood count and the basic metabolic panel, was unremarkable.\n",
      "In the emergency department, the patient received immediate dual antiplatelet therapy, and cutaneous pacer pads were applied. Due to the focal exam findings, a computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) was performed rapidly with quick review ruling out dissection. CTA however revealed a small transverse, linear defect in the proximal aorta (Figure ). This defect was noted to propagate towards the root of the aortic valve on its anterior leaflet suggesting possible vegetation on the aortic valve. Given the ST changes and ongoing chest pain, the patient was taken immediately for cardiac catheterization which revealed a distal thrombus in the posterior left ventricular branch of the right coronary artery which was not amenable for intervention (Figures , ). During cardiac catheterization, right lower extremity pain and coolness suddenly worsened. Angiogram of the right lower extremity showed 100% occlusion of the right anterior and posterior tibial arteries (Figure ). The patient then went for emergent thrombo-embolectomy of the right tibio-peroneal trunk, with a marked resolution of symptoms. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed later confirming the vegetation in the aortic valve measuring about 6.5x4.0 mm (Figure ). Three sets of blood cultures were negative. Significant remarkable lab findings included C-reactive protein (CRP) of 10.5 ng/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 60 mm/hr, and positive rheumatoid arthritis screen. Extensive rheumatological and hypercoagulable workup including anti-nuclear antibodies, complement levels, anti-thrombin III activity, protein C & S levels, homocysteine levels, and other procoagulant markers were within the normal range. Specific testing for systemic scleroderma, Sjogren’s, and polymyositis were also unremarkable. Confirmatory testing with anti-cyclic citrullinated protein showed levels of >250 units establishing the diagnosis of RA. The patient was treated with systemic oral anticoagulation and was initiated on steroids.\n",

Significant remarkable lab findings included C-reactive protein (CRP) of 10.5 ng/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 60 mm/hr, and positive rheumatoid arthritis screen. Extensive rheumatological and hypercoagulable workup including anti-nuclear antibodies, complement levels, anti-thrombin III activity, protein C & S levels, homocysteine levels, and other procoagulant markers were within the normal range. Specific testing for systemic scleroderma, Sjogren’s, and polymyositis were also unremarkable. Confirmatory testing with anti-cyclic citrullinated protein showed levels of >250 units establishing the diagnosis of RA. The patient was treated with systemic oral anticoagulation and was initiated on steroids.\n",

      "An eighty-five-year-old female presented to the emergency room with complaints of sudden onset substernal chest pain and dizziness. Her past medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation. She had a pacemaker inserted at another facility 2 weeks before. No perioperative complications were reported and patient had been doing well without any complaints till the day of presentation. Medications included dabigatran for her atrial fibrillation. On examination, the patient was diaphoretic but in no respiratory distress. Temperature was 97°F, pulse 96/minute, irregular; systolic blood pressure was 70 mm Hg; respiratory rate was 22/minute; and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. No jugular venous distension was noted. Cardiac examination revealed irregular rhythm, no murmur or rub. Lung auscultation revealed slightly diminished breath sounds at left base. Chest X-ray showed a mild-to-moderate left-sided pleural effusion; pacemaker leads appeared to be in the right ventricle (). Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed trioventricular (AV) sequential pacing (). Echocardiogram (ECHO) revealed no wall motion abnormality with normal ejection fraction. Pacemaker leads were visualized in the right ventricle (RV) on ECHO. Her hemoglobin was 8 gm%; prothrombin time (PT) was 19 seconds; and INR was 2.9.\n",
      "No pacing or sensing failure was noted on device interrogation. The patient's hypotension persisted despite vigorous intravenous fluid resuscitation including transfusion of 2 units of blood cell and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma and improvement in her hemoglobin to 11 gm%. A computed tomogram (CT) of the chest was performed which showed a moderate left pleural effusion, with the pacemaker wire extending to the left pleural cavity and a small localized pericardial effusion adjoining the pleural effusion (). The patient's hemodynamic instability was not due to tamponade effect as the pericardial effusion was small but due to continued hemorrhage into the pleural cavity due to her coagulopathic state from being on dabigatran for her atrial fibrillation, which was not fully corrected by fresh frozen plasma infusion.\n",
      "The patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent a median sternotomy. The pacemaker lead was found to be protruding out of the right ventricle (). The external portion was cut with the remaining intracardiac portion of the pacemaker lead left in place. The perforation of the RV wall was repaired. The hemothorax and hemopericardium were evacuated. Subsequently, the patient's hemodynamic status improved. Two days later, the remaining portion of the pacemaker lead was removed transvenously. A new pacemaker was inserted transvenously and placed on the right ventricular septum. The patient did not have further complications and was discharged home subsequently.

      "A 35-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome was admitted at 37 weeks gestational age (GA). She was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome at 16 years of age. A previous pregnancy at 33 years of age culminated in a missed abortion at 6 weeks GA, for which a dilatation and curettage was performed at our hospital under monitored anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. She underwent a Bentall operation due to aortic regurgitation at 20 years of age. She underwent a vitrectomy at 27 years of age for subluxation of the right lens. She had orthostatic headaches 3 years ago, and dural ectasia at the 5th lumbar and sacrum, which was identified on lumborsacral spine magnetic resonance myelography, was thought to be the cause of the symptoms. At the time of admission, she had a 35-mm abdominal aortic aneurysm for 8 years. The cardiac functions were stable because the previous aortic surgical procedures were well-maintained during the current pregnancy. She was medicated with verapamil, atenolol, and warfarin, which were switched to labetalol and enoxaparin during the pregnancy.\n",
      "She had the pathognomic body habitus of Marfan syndrome (height, 179 cm; weight, 76.2 kg; and arachnodactyly). A metallic click and systolic murmur were auscultated with a stethoscope. Her initial vital signs showed a blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 80/min, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. A pre-operative echocardiography revealed a normal left ventricle ejection fraction (55-60%) and a well-functioning prosthetic aortic valve. Mild ectatic changes in the proximal descending thoracic aorta and distal abdominal aorta (32 × 36 and 34 × 31 mm, respectively) were confirmed with no interval changes compared to the last study checked 1 year ago.\n",
      "An elective cesarean section was recommended by the obstetricians, cardiologists, and anesthesiologists involved in the patient's care. Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia is the standard anesthetic choice for cesarean section at our hospital. However, the presence of dural ectasia at the 5th lumbar and sacrum, and a neurosurgeon's warning against spinal anesthesia for the possible recurrence of headache associated with CSF leakage, led us to decide on epidural anesthesia. Enoxaparin was discontinued one day before the scheduled cesarean section and unfractionated conventional heparin was administered until 6 hours before the operation.\n",
      "With the patient in the right lateral position, a 17-gauge Tuohy needle was inserted at the L3-4 interspace under sterile conditions using a midline approach with the loss-ofair resistance technique. Then, a 19-gauge epidural catheter (FlexTip Plus®; Arrow, USA) was inserted via the Tuohy needle and fixed at 9 cm. Eight ml of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine (1 : 200,000) and fentanyl (50 µg) were injected via an epidural catheter as a divided first dose, and the total 27 ml of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine (1 : 200,000) and fentanyl (100 µg) was injected incrementally over 10 minutes. Twenty minutes after the last epidural injection of lidocaine, the sensory block was sufficiently high (T4) for the cesarean section. The systolic blood pressure was decreased by 25% and 3 doses of phenylephrine (100 µg) and 1 dose of ephedrine (10 mg) were administered to maintain the blood pressure at 100/50 mmHg. She was sedated with propofol after the infant was delivered and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. The baby had been diagnosed prenatally with possible Marfan syndrome and was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. The patient's post-operative vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 106/68 mmHg, a heart rate of 83/min, and an oxygen saturation of 100%. Heparin was re-infused 6 hours after the cesarean section. The post-operative pain was managed with patient-controlled epidural analgesia for 3 days post-operatively. The epidural catheter was removed 6 hours after stopping the continuous heparin injection on the 3rd post-operative day. She was transferred to the Cardiology Department for postpartum management and discharged without cardiovascular complications.\n",

Mild ectatic changes in the proximal descending thoracic aorta and distal abdominal aorta (32 × 36 and 34 × 31 mm, respectively) were confirmed with no interval changes compared to the last study checked 1 year ago.\n",
      "An elective cesarean section was recommended by the obstetricians, cardiologists, and anesthesiologists involved in the patient's care. Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia is the standard anesthetic choice for cesarean section at our hospital. However, the presence of dural ectasia at the 5th lumbar and sacrum, and a neurosurgeon's warning against spinal anesthesia for the possible recurrence of headache associated with CSF leakage, led us to decide on epidural anesthesia. Enoxaparin was discontinued one day before the scheduled cesarean section and unfractionated conventional heparin was administered until 6 hours before the operation.\n",
      "With the patient in the right lateral position, a 17-gauge Tuohy needle was inserted at the L3-4 interspace under sterile conditions using a midline approach with the loss-ofair resistance technique. Then, a 19-gauge epidural catheter (FlexTip Plus®; Arrow, USA) was inserted via the Tuohy needle and fixed at 9 cm. Eight ml of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine (1 : 200,000) and fentanyl (50 µg) were injected via an epidural catheter as a divided first dose, and the total 27 ml of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine (1 : 200,000) and fentanyl (100 µg) was injected incrementally over 10 minutes. Twenty minutes after the last epidural injection of lidocaine, the sensory block was sufficiently high (T4) for the cesarean section. The systolic blood pressure was decreased by 25% and 3 doses of phenylephrine (100 µg) and 1 dose of ephedrine (10 mg) were administered to maintain the blood pressure at 100/50 mmHg. She was sedated with propofol after the infant was delivered and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. The baby had been diagnosed prenatally with possible Marfan syndrome and was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. The patient's post-operative vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 106/68 mmHg, a heart rate of 83/min, and an oxygen saturation of 100%. Heparin was re-infused 6 hours after the cesarean section. The post-operative pain was managed with patient-controlled epidural analgesia for 3 days post-operatively. The epidural catheter was removed 6 hours after stopping the continuous heparin injection on the 3rd post-operative day. She was transferred to the Cardiology Department for postpartum management and discharged without cardiovascular complications.\n",

      "A 73-year-old woman presented with three days of progressively worsening sharp non-radiating reproducible left-sided thoracic pain exacerbated by movement of the ipsilateral upper extremity. Her past medical history was significant for a myocardial infarction two decades prior with resultant ischemic cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and a biventricular pacemaker and defibrillator in place. Initial examination revealed normal vital signs, non-distended neck veins, and left-sided chest wall tenderness to palpation. Electrocardiography displayed a ventricular-paced rhythm and left bundle branch block not meeting the Sgarbossa criteria for ischemia. Three serial troponin I assays were negative. Chest radiograph showed dual chamber pacer wires in place without cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusions. Biventricular pacemaker interrogation revealed no arrhythmic events but indicated the need for battery replacement. Her symptoms were attributed to noncardiac musculoskeletal chest pain, and she was discharged home with plans for elective pacemaker battery replacement.\n",
      "Two weeks later, the patient presented with dyspnea, orthopnea, and retrosternal chest pain. On physical examination, the patient was afebrile, and she had a blood pressure of 172/64 mmHg, pulse rate of 67 beats/minute, and respiration rate of 18 breaths/minute. Her oxygen saturation was 99% on 3 L of oxygen per minute. Cardiac examination revealed non-distended neck veins, normal heart sounds, diminished bilateral lung sounds, and mild bilateral pedal edema. Electrocardiogram was similar to the prior, and serial cardiac enzymes were normal. The brain natriuretic peptide level was elevated at 2,042 pg/mL. Chest radiograph showed increased vascular markings and cardiomegaly. Immediate intravenous loop diuretics and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation were initiated with symptomatic improvement. In the setting of unstable angina with decompensated heart failure, urgent cardiac catheterization was performed, revealing a totally occluded right coronary artery, normal left coronaries, and a calcified, well-demarcated, large left ventricular infero-basal aneurysm with a 28 mm neck opening (Figure ). Cardiac computed tomography with angiography (Figures and 3) and transesophageal echocardiography (Figure ) showed a 46 x 45 x 47 mm aneurysm originating just at the takeoff of the posterior mitral valve leaflet (increased in size when compared with prior images) and severe mitral regurgitation. The patient underwent surgical mitral valve repair, aneurysmectomy, and pericardial patching. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 30%-35% to 40%-45% postoperatively. Following the initial recovery period, the patient reported better exercise tolerance and improved quality of life, and she did not require further heart failure or angina-related hospitalizations to date.\n",

Complete blood count and complete metabolic panel were remarkable for sodium of 133 mmol/L, blood glucose of 230 mg/dL, and a creatinine of 1.51 mg/dL. Troponin was elevated at 0.307 ng/ml and it slowly trended down afterwards. He was transferred to our facility on hospital day 2. The initial workup at our facility was unremarkable with a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL and negative troponin level. Hemoglobin A1c was 8.7%. His inflammatory markers were markedly elevated, with a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 34.86 mg/dL and a D-dimer of 462. A CXR showed bilateral infiltrate (Figure ). He was placed on airborne and contact precautions.

      "A 65-year-old male presented with an abrupt onset of sharp, burning, constant right lower abdominal pain after previously been feeling well. There was no history of trauma, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, dysuria, hematuria or melena. His past medical history included hypertension, atrial flutter and cardiomyopathy, and he had an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD). There was no prior history of abdominal aortic aneurysm in the patient or in his family. His past surgical history included an inguinal hernia repair. His medications included aspirin, valsartan, metoprolol and atorvastatin. He did not smoke, use alcohol or illicit drugs.\n",
      "Physical exam showed vitals signs as follows: body temperature of 36.3°C, blood pressure of 140/82 mmHg, heart rate of 52 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and pulsoximetry of 98% on room air. He was alert, but appeared in mild distress due to pain. His abdominal exam revealed tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, with no rebound, guarding, distention or organomegaly. The remainder of the exam was normal.\n",
      "The initial emergency department evaluation included an electrocardiogram that showed atrial flutter with a 4:1 block. Laboratory assessment revealed trace hematuria, no leukocytosis, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL (normal range, 0.7–1.4 mg/dL), mildly elevated lipase to 85 U/L (normal range, 12–70 U/L), mild hyperglycemia and mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase to 46 U/L (normal range, 7–40 U/L). The lactate and coagulation profiles were within normal limits. Lactate dehydrogenase was not ordered at presentation, but obtained 2 days after admission, and was elevated at 1,479 U/L (normal range, 100–220 U/L). Lactate dehydrogenase is present in the renal tissue and elevates in serum after kidney insult, and it is unknown whether this level correlates to the severity of the infarct.\n",
      "Given the nature of the pain and the hematuria seen on urinalysis and the history of cardiomyopathy with atrial flutter, both nephrolithiasis and mesenteric ischemia were strongly considered as causes for this acute pain. Therefore, both non-contrast- and contrast-enhanced helical computed tomography (CT) images [Figures and ] were obtained, which showed extensive infarction involving the upper pole of the right kidney with multiple patchy infarcts into the lower pole, a patent right renal artery, but no visualization of the interparenchymal arterial branches within the mid and upper poles of the right kidney, suggesting arterial thromboembolic disease. There was poor opacification of the right renal vein, and, therefore, renal vein thrombus could not be ruled out. A 2-mm left renal calculus was also identified.\n",
      "The urology and vascular surgery services were consulted, and both recommended conservative treatment with anticoagulation. In addition to normal saline and dilaudid for pain control, a heparin bolus of 80 mg/kg was given and an infusion at 18 mg/kg/h was initiated, with the patient being admitted to the general medicine service.\n",
      "It was concluded his renal artery thrombosis was most likely embolic and a 2-D echocardiogram was ordered, which showed no intramural thrombus. He was discharged 5 days later, on coumadin. His creatinine, which was 1.3 mg/dL on admission, rose to 1.8 mg/dL and fell to 1.7 mg/dL by discharge. One month later, the creatinine levels had declined to 1.6 mg/dL.\n",

It was not associated with any alleviating or aggravating factors. On the day of presentation, she became lightheaded and experience shortness of breath. The discomfort was associated with two episodes of nonbloody emesis and left-sided pleuritic chest pain. She did not have any retrosternal chest pain, diaphoresis, or syncopal episode. She was, additionally, complaining of right lower leg cramping. Her medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and deep vein thrombosis, which was treated with an oral anticoagulant for six months. The initial vitals were blood pressure of 125/62 mmHg, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air; she was afebrile. The cardiopulmonary exam was unremarkable. The initial troponin level was 0.02 ng/mL (normal: 0–0.10 ng/mL), eight hours apart. The pro-BNP level was at 7511 pg/mL (normal: 50–92 pg/mL). An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without significant findings. A CT-chest with contrast showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary emboli in the right and left main pulmonary arteries and straightening of the interventricular septum suggestive of right ventricular strain (). The echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction, hypokinetic RV, mild pulmonary hypertension (RVSP of 49 mmHg), and RV/LV > 1 ().

Thyroid-stimulating hormone was low (0.01μunit/ml; normal: 0.5–5.0 μunit/ml) with high free thyroxine (7.77 ng/dL; normal: 0.75 to 1.8 ng/dL). The patient complained of worsening weakness in her legs. She was given additional 40 mEq of oral potassium. Potassium was increased to 30 mEq/hour IV, and the patient was admitted to medical intensive care unit.\n",
      "A diagnosis of TPP was made based on clinical presentation and laboratory results. Blood drawn after eight hours showed potassium of 6.6 mEq/L. Intravenous potassium was stopped, and intravenous dose of 1 gm calcium, 50% solution of 50 ml dextrose, and 10 units of insulin were given urgently to correct hyperkalemia. Despite these, the patient developed episodes of ventricular fibrillation and despite several attempts at electrical cardioversion, she died. Her potassium level was 10.1 mEq/L at the time of her death.\n",

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 29-year-old man presented to the emergency department after one week of repeated bouts of crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea, which became bloody on the day of arrival. There was no fever, nausea, or vomiting.\n",
      "He was evaluated several times in the Emergency Medicine Department during the previous three months, with various abdominal complaints that resolved after symptomatic relief without further investigation. The patient reported no additional symptoms or relevant personal or familial medical history. He worked as a bus driver, smoked cigarettes for many years, and did not drink alcohol regularly.\n",
      "The patient reported daily usage of “Mr. Nice Guy” for the last few months but denied use of any other drugs or supplements. Consumption of SCs was via smoking, and he denied other means of administration such as oral or intravenous. This information was validated by collateral anamnesis of visiting friends.\n",
      "In the emergency department, the patient was hemodynamically stable with initial BP recordings of 159/100 mmHg, regular heart rate of 99 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 99% on ambient air. Physical examination was unremarkable except for intense borborygmi and mild abnormal tenderness. Initial blood work showed leukocytosis of 20,000 cells/mcL with neutrophilia (80%) and normal hemoglobin (15.1 grams/dL). Biochemistry, including electrolytes, kidney function tests, liver, and pancreatic enzymes, were all within normal limits. Urinalysis was unremarkable, and urine toxicology screen was slightly positive for amphetamines and benzodiazepines but negative for other screened drugs including THC, opiates, and cocaine. Upon repeated questioning, patient once again denied use of any other stimulant including amphetamines, besides “Mr. Nice Guy.” White cell count increased to 28,000 cells/mcL six hours later, and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) performed without IV or PO contrast enhancement was unremarkable. Over the next four days the patient continued to complain of intermittent episodes of crampy abdominal pain with episodic diarrhea, followed by pain-free periods during which he strolled freely around the hospital, admitting that he was still smoking “Mr. Nice Guy,” provided to him by his friends. Additional toxic screens were not performed during hospitalization due to lack of the patient's cooperation. Leukocytosis gradually resolved. Blood, stool, and urinary cultures were negative and other laboratory data were unremarkable, with the exception of hypophosphatemia (0.5 mmol/L, normal = 0.8–1.4) and increasing C-reactive protein (22 mg/dL, normal < 0.5 mg/dL). During his hospitalization we abstained giving the patient medications from the family of benzodiazepines, potent opiates, and any medications which involve potential future addiction.\n",
      "On the fifth hospitalization day, an abdominal X-ray, taken during a bout of abdominal pain, demonstrated dilated small bowel loops without features of intestinal obstruction or perforation, consistent with paralytic ileus. Later that day, the pain subsided and the patient requested to take a walk around the hospital, as our internal medicine ward regulations permit stable patients to leave their rooms. Obviously, hospitalized patients are not permitted to use any form of drug or medication not provided to them by hospital staff.\n",
      "However upon returning from his walk, the patient admitted that he had once again consumed “Mr. Nice Guy” with one a friend who came to visit him. Routine checkup of vital signs revealed elevated blood pressure 180/110 mmHg with a heart rate of 120/min, without fever. Six hours later, he developed sudden extreme abdominal pain and was found to be in profound shock vomiting “coffee ground” material. Physical examination revealed abdominal guarding and rebound tenderness compatible with peritonitis, and laboratory evaluation disclosed hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, and worsening kidney function. An emergent surgical intervention was considered for an evolving abdominal catastrophe, but the patient quickly went into pulseless electrical activity with subsequent cardiac arrest.\n",
      "A request for autopsy was declined by the patient's family, but a postmortem CT scan one hour after death revealed extensive pneumatosis intestinalis of the entire small bowel, right colon and sigmoid, gas in the portal system, and blood vessels, with free air and unclear fluid in the peritoneal cavity (Figures and ). These findings were consistent with acute intestinal perforation most probably due to a nonobstructive mesenteric infarction (NOMI) as the cause of death. There was no evidence of single vessel infarction, rather of diffuse ischemia, possibly due to splanchnic vasospasm. Air in the aorta, right ventricle, and biliary tract were conceivably postmortem changes. Urinary toxic screen sampled during hemodynamic resuscitation was positive for methadone, THC, and benzodiazepines, but negative for cocaine, opiates, and amphetamines. Unfortunately, due to technical failure, the final urine sample was not sent for confirmatory mass spectrometry testing.\n",

      "We report the case of a 9-year-old Saudi male who presented at King Abdulaziz University Hospital with a 3-day history of pallor, lethargy, shortness of breath, and headache. Along with these manifestations, the family noticed a yellowish discoloration of the sclera. The patient was in optimal health, with no significant medical complaints, until 2 weeks prior to hospital admission, a time when he developed symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (i.e., a sore throat, cough, and mild subjective fever). One week later, he developed diarrhea with a frequency greater than 5 times daily. The diarrhea was yellowish in color and without blood. Furthermore, the diarrhea was associated with epigastric pain and vomiting, and it resolved a few days later; however, the epigastric pain became more severe, and his vomiting continued. Due to this situation, the patient had been unable to maintain his usual appetite and had lost some weight. The patient also reported a decrease in the amount of his urine and a change of the urine's color, which was described by the mother as tea-colored. No rash or edema was reported.\n",

      "Examination showed that the patient was conscious and oriented; he was pale and had yellowish sclera but exhibited no other significant signs (i.e., no periorbital or lower limb edema, skin rash, or petechia). His chest was clear, and the heart sounds were normal, with no additional sounds or murmurs. A neurological examination was unremarkable.\n",

      "A 62-year-old woman underwent a right mastectomy with axillary node dissection for a poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma. One month later she underwent left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. After 14 days, she received her first cycle of CMF as a part of her breast cancer treatment. Two weeks later, she developed progressive shortness-of-breath, dry cough, and mild fever, for which she was started on antibiotics for possible pneumonia. Two days later, her respiratory status deteriorated and she required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Because of hemodynamic instability and hypotension, she was started on inotropes and transferred to the intensive care unit. On examination, her blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, pulse of 104 beats per minute, normal temperature, and her jugular venous pressure was 8 cm above the sternal angle. Chest examinations revealed bilateral bronchial breathing and diffuse crackles. Cardiovascular and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Her initial chest x-ray showed bilateral mixed alveolar and interstitial infiltrates with volume loss (). Her arterial blood gases on room air prior to intubation, were partial pressure of oxygen 47torr, partial pressure of carbon dioxide 32torr, pH 7.49, bicarbonate 21, O2 saturation was 85%. The PAP was 36/21 mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 12 mm Hg, central venous pressure 20 cm H2O, cardiac index of 2.0 L/min/m2, and calculated PVR was 560 dynes sec/cm-5 (). A spiral CT of the chest showed a non-occlusive saddle pulmonary embolism with multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli (Figures ). She was treated with thrombolytics (100 mg rt-PA) followed by heparin without complications. She improved hemodynamically, and the inotropes were discontinued. Doppler ultrasound of the legs confirmed bilateral deep vein thrombosis.

      "A 62-year-old woman underwent a right mastectomy with axillary node dissection for a poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma. One month later she underwent left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. After 14 days, she received her first cycle of CMF as a part of her breast cancer treatment. Two weeks later, she developed progressive shortness-of-breath, dry cough, and mild fever, for which she was started on antibiotics for possible pneumonia. Two days later, her respiratory status deteriorated and she required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Because of hemodynamic instability and hypotension, she was started on inotropes and transferred to the intensive care unit. On examination, her blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, pulse of 104 beats per minute, normal temperature, and her jugular venous pressure was 8 cm above the sternal angle. Chest examinations revealed bilateral bronchial breathing and diffuse crackles. Cardiovascular and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Her initial chest x-ray showed bilateral mixed alveolar and interstitial infiltrates with volume loss (). Her arterial blood gases on room air prior to intubation, were partial pressure of oxygen 47torr, partial pressure of carbon dioxide 32torr, pH 7.49, bicarbonate 21, O2 saturation was 85%. The PAP was 36/21 mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 12 mm Hg, central venous pressure 20 cm H2O, cardiac index of 2.0 L/min/m2, and calculated PVR was 560 dynes sec/cm-5 (). A spiral CT of the chest showed a non-occlusive saddle pulmonary embolism with multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli (Figures ). She was treated with thrombolytics (100 mg rt-PA) followed by heparin without complications. She improved hemodynamically, and the inotropes were discontinued. Doppler ultrasound of the legs confirmed bilateral deep vein thrombosis. Because of persistent pulmonary infiltrates (Figures ), she underwent a fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, which was negative. This was followed by open lung biopsy that showed loose organizing granulation tissue in the small airways consistent with BOOP ().

      "The patient had been addicted to N2O for 1 year; as a result, peripheral neuropathy had occurred and was treated with vitamin B12 (Vit B12). His medical history included poor blood glucose control and anxiety. However, he had no history of thrombosis, malignant tumor, recent trauma, or prolonged air travel.\n",
      "The patient has smoked over 13 pack-years and did not have alcoholism or a positive family history.\n",
      "The initial assessment revealed that the patient was overweight and fragile, with a body mass index of 31.12 kg/m2, temperature of 36.3 °C, blood pressure of 110-120/70-80 mmHg, heart rate over 110 beats/min, respiratory rate over 30 breaths/min, and pulse oximetry of 93% when the fraction of inspired oxygen was 49%. Moreover, the physical examination indicated diminished breath sounds on both sides and the accentuation of pulmonic second sounds.\n",
      "Laboratory data showed a high leukocyte count and an increased hemoglobin level, suggested abnormal liver biochemistry and hyperlipidemia, and revealed HHcy (24.12 µmol/L), high Vit B12 (734 µmol/L), and normal folate (14.39 nmol/L). The results of the protein S, protein C, anti-thrombin III antibody, anti-cardiolipin antibody, lupus anticoagulant, anti-β2gp1 autoantibody, and other autoantibodies were within normal limits. The clotting profile was normal, other than the D-dimer value (1.13 mg/L), and thrombophilia screening was negative. As markers in the risk stratification of PE, the levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cardiac troponin I (CTnI) were 533 pg/mL and 0.334 ng/mL, respectively. Arterial blood gas levels measured with an oxygen concentration of 49% showed the following: pH, 7.44; PaCO2, 30 mmHg; and PaO2, 74 mmHg.\n",
      "An electrocardiogram (ECG, Figure ) showed sinus tachycardia with typical changes on SIQIIITIII (S wave in the aVL lead, Q wave and T wave in the III lead). Ultrasonic cardiogram demonstrated right ventricular enlargement with left ventricular compression. Color Doppler scans were used to explore femoral, popliteal, and calf muscular venous thrombosis in the right extremity.

      "Sudden-onset chest pain for 1 d.\n",
      "A 29-year-old man complained of sudden precordial pain with no remission for 1 d prior to hospital admission but denied hemoptysis, dyspnea, or syncope. He sought evaluation and was admitted for the purpose of intensive examination and treatment.\n",
      "The patient had been addicted to N2O for 1 year; as a result, peripheral neuropathy had occurred and was treated with vitamin B12 (Vit B12). His medical history included poor blood glucose control and anxiety. However, he had no history of thrombosis, malignant tumor, recent trauma, or prolonged air travel.\n",
      "The patient has smoked over 13 pack-years and did not have alcoholism or a positive family history.\n",
      "The initial assessment revealed that the patient was overweight and fragile, with a body mass index of 31.12 kg/m2, temperature of 36.3 °C, blood pressure of 110-120/70-80 mmHg, heart rate over 110 beats/min, respiratory rate over 30 breaths/min, and pulse oximetry of 93% when the fraction of inspired oxygen was 49%. Moreover, the physical examination indicated diminished breath sounds on both sides and the accentuation of pulmonic second sounds.\n",
      "Laboratory data showed a high leukocyte count and an increased hemoglobin level, suggested abnormal liver biochemistry and hyperlipidemia, and revealed HHcy (24.12 µmol/L), high Vit B12 (734 µmol/L), and normal folate (14.39 nmol/L). The results of the protein S, protein C, anti-thrombin III antibody, anti-cardiolipin antibody, lupus anticoagulant, anti-β2gp1 autoantibody, and other autoantibodies were within normal limits. The clotting profile was normal, other than the D-dimer value (1.13 mg/L), and thrombophilia screening was negative. As markers in the risk stratification of PE, the levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cardiac troponin I (CTnI) were 533 pg/mL and 0.334 ng/mL, respectively. Arterial blood gas levels measured with an oxygen concentration of 49% showed the following: pH, 7.44; PaCO2, 30 mmHg; and PaO2, 74 mmHg.\n",
      "An electrocardiogram (ECG, Figure ) showed sinus tachycardia with typical changes on SIQIIITIII (S wave in the aVL lead, Q wave and T wave in the III lead). Ultrasonic cardiogram demonstrated right ventricular enlargement with left ventricular compression. Color Doppler scans were used to explore femoral, popliteal, and calf muscular venous thrombosis in the right extremity. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) revealed occlusion of the pulmonary artery trunk, lobar artery, and arterial branches on both sides and signs of increased right heart load (Figure and ).\n",

      "A 56-year-old man was electively admitted for investigation of his abdominal pains. He had surgery for traumatic fracture of his right leg three weeks ago and was discharged without any complications. He did not have any other major co-morbidity and was not taking any regular medications. Few days into the hospital stay, he suddenly became short of breath and unwell with severe hypoxemia, hypotension and tachycardia. His peripheral oxygen saturations dropped to 85% on room air. His systolic blood pressure was 60 mmHg with heart rate of 120 per minute. After initial stabilization, urgent computerised tomography scan of the chest was performed that revealed filling defects in the distal main pulmonary artery extending bilaterally up to the interlobar and its segmental branches, consistent with thrombi (, top left). It also revealed dilated pulmonary trunk (24 mm) with a filling defect in the right atrium (, top right). A trans-thoracic echocardiography was immediately performed to assess the right atrial mass. It showed a free-floating thrombus in the right atrium (RA) with a ‘snake-like’ configuration (, bottom panel).\n",
      "The right ventricle was moderately enlarged with systolic impairment. The inferior vena cava was free of masses. There was moderate pulmonary hypertension with peak pulmonary pressure of 45 mmHg. Serum biochemistry revealed markedly raised troponin and brain-natriuretic peptide levels. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit where he was intubated and ventilated, and needed extensive support with vasopressors. He also received thrombolysis with reteplase. A repeat echocardiography after thrombolysis showed absence of the previously seen thrombus in the right atrium, which had likely lysed and migrated to the pulmonary vasculature. The patient, however, never recovered from this massive pulmonary vascular insult and remained in the intensive care unit for the next few days. He deteriorated gradually until he passed away.\n",

      "A 68-year-old man attended the Accident and Emergency department with increasing breathlessness but no chest pain, sputum production or haemoptysis. He had recently returned from holiday in Spain and his general practitioner prescribed amoxicillin for a presumed chest infection. He was a diet-controlled type 2 diabetic on treatment for hypertension. He had a 40-pack-year smoking history and had lost 4 kg in weight. Examination revealed an obese man with normal blood pressure, sinus tachycardia at 100 beats⋅min−1, with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths⋅min−1. His oxygen saturation was 96% on air. His white cell count was 11×109 cells⋅L−1 and C-reactive protein was 92 mg⋅L−1. Renal function and coagulation studies were normal.\n",
      "The admitting medical team felt that there was a “complete whiteout” of the left hemithorax and initially treated him for suspected severe community-­acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics and fluids, while arranging a respiratory opinion. Prophylactic low molecular weight ­heparin (LMWH) was also started. The respiratory team felt that an underlying malignancy may have been responsible for the radiographic appearances of left upper lobe collapse and suggested a ­computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax. shows a “veil-like” opacity projected over the left lung field, a raised left hemidiaphragm with blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with left upper lobe collapse, volume loss and an associated pleural effusion.\n",
      "The CT scan showed a large left hilar mass coalescing with the left upper lobe collapse. There were associated large para-aortic, subcarinal, mediastinal and supraclavicular nodes, a single liver metastasis and a second separate mass in the right lung. Lung cancer staging was T4N3M1b.\n",
      "It was interesting to note that a separate mass was present in the right lung (c). He did have metastatic disease but this might represent a synchronous primary, although by strict definition, to diagnose this, we needed to prove that the second mass was of different histology to the primary mass or that it was of the same histology but with no mediastinal or metastatic spread [].\n",
      "While awaiting a bronchoscopy, the patient coughed up ∼600 mL of fresh blood in 12 h, with worsening hypoxia. Repeat full blood count and coagulation studies were normal.\n",
      "The patient was having massive haemoptysis, defined as coughing up anything between 100 mL and 600 mL of fresh blood in 24 h [].\n",
      "He was seen by the on-call medical team and sat upright. Two large-bore cannulae were inserted in case of exsanguination. Sitting upright runs the risk of the blood spilling over into the normal lung. “Drowning” by filling up the bronchial tree with blood tends to occur before any true haemodynamic instability due to volume loss. As such, the mainstay of treatment in massive haem­optysis is to protect the normal lung and try to stop the bleeding [, ].\n",
      "The respiratory team felt that a palliative approach was too premature, but it was explained to him that his prognosis was poor with limited treatment options available. He agreed to a “do not resuscitate” plan. A treatment escalation plan was agreed to ensure his treatment was limited to level 2 care. Hypoxia precluded a bronchoscopy or transfer to the local cardiothoracic centre. Bronchoscopic strategies to control pulmonary haemorrhage include balloon tamponade, iced saline lavage, administration of a topical vasoconstrictor or coagulant, laser therapy and electrocautery [].\n",
      "The patient pointed to his left hemithorax when asked which side he felt the bleeding was coming from. Anecdotal experience suggests that patients with haemoptysis can often accurately indicate the side of the bleeding lesion. He was therefore positioned on his left side and tranexamic acid was administered intravenously. A pilot study evaluating the effect of tranexamic acid and the related antifibrinolytic agent aminocaproic acid included three patients with haemoptysis due to lung cancer []. All three patients experienced cessation of bleeding within 1–4 days without any recurrence. Patients received 1.5 g of intravenous tranexamic acid initially, followed by 1 g three times per day for a week after cessation of bleeding. The use of tranexamic acid in bleeding has been recognised for a long time [] and tranexamic acid may reduce both the duration and volume of bleeding, with low risk of short-term thromboembolic complications [].\n",
      "His haemoptysis and hypoxia improved over the ensuing days, and at bronchoscopy an organised clot was visualised in the left upper lobe bronchus with no endobronchial masses and a normal right bronchial tree. Left upper lobe lavage revealed no malignant cells on cytology. At endobronchial ultrasound examination, a large paratracheal node was sampled and histology demonstrated a poorly differentiated necrotic squamous cell carcinoma.\n",
      "The patient’s clinical condition slowly improved until 15 days into his admission, when overnight he developed acute dyspnoea with tachycardia at 120 beats⋅min−1. Arterial blood gas sampling measured his arterial oxygen tension (PaO) at 7.0 kPa on high flow oxygen via a reservoir bag, and an arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO) of 5.1 kPa. A repeat chest radiograph showed no change.\n",
      "The PA–aO is a measure of the difference between the alveolar concentration (A) of oxygen and the arterial (a) concentration of oxygen. In room air (inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.21) at sea level (atmospheric pressure of 760 mmHg) assuming 100% humidity in the alveoli, a simplified version of the equation is 21−((PaCO/0.8)−PaO), 0.8 being the respiratory quotient.\n",
      "High flow oxygen delivers ∼85% oxygen, so 85−(5.1/0.8)−7=71.625, which is significantly raised. While his PA–aO was likely to be raised due to his cancer/effusion, such a disparity and the clinical picture points towards the possibility of a pulmonary embolus. The use of the PA–aO is a useful adjunct in diagnosis []. There are numerous case reports about tranexamic acid increasing the risk of pulmonary emboli [, ]. In this case, the patient had other significant risk factors such as disseminated malignancy and a prolonged period of immobility.\n",
      "The patient understood that if left untreated, a large pulmonary embolus may prove fatal, but by treating it with anticoagulation, a major fatal haemoptysis was also more likely. He agreed to receive LMWH together with morphine for symptoms of dyspnoea and agitation. 6 h later, he had improved clinically and was able to safely lie flat briefly for a CT pulmonary angiogram. This confirmed large right-sided pulmonary emboli with associated right heart strain with reflux of contrast into the venous circulation (). The option of inferior vena cava filter insertion to prevent further embolic events was not available in our hospital, and he was too unstable to be transferred to an appropriate tertiary hospital. Over the following 2 days, urgent palliative radiotherapy to the left-sided tumour was arranged. After he had received a single fraction, further large volume haemoptysis recurred. LMWH was stopped and tranexamic acid restarted. The bleeding settled once more and he completed five fractions of radiotherapy. Slowly his oxygen saturations improved to 93% on air and he was discharged home on long-term full-dose LMWH with no recurrence of the haem­optysis.\n",
      "He presented 3 weeks later with progressive respiratory failure and his symptoms were palliated according to his wishes.\n",

      "A 46-year-old woman was urgently presented to a nearby hospital because of a femur fracture caused by an accident. Although she was alert on arrival, she began to experience sleepiness approximately 5 hours later. A follow-up helical computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed the absence of any additional severe lesions or skull fractures. Chest CT confirmed an exudative lesion, and a pulmonary vascular computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed no obvious abnormalities. Based on the clinical and imaging findings, the patient was suspected to have CFE. After 2 days, the patient was moved to our neurology department to receive the appropriate care. Immediate physical examination on arrival revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 4, a positive bilateral Babinski sign, a positive Kernig sign, and neck stiffness. The patients left thigh presented bruising and swelling and had been fixed with external fixation with restrained movement in the previous hospital (Fig. A). She presented an arterial pressure of 148/80 mm Hg, heart rate of 124 bpm, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 64 mm Hg. Her blood gas analysis revealed a pH value of 7.4. Total body CT revealed a left femoral comminuted fracture with dislocation (Fig. B). Her bilateral lung presented an exudative lesion as well as pleural effusion (Fig. A). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed diffuse abnormal signals in the bilateral cerebral hemisphere, brainstem, and cerebellum, which were suggestive of embolization (Fig. ). Combined with the patients trauma history and imaging findings of the lung and brain, the patient was initially diagnosed with FES, whose corresponding treatment is mainly supportive. Regarding the closed fracture of the left femur, the external fixation that had been performed at the previous hospital was appropriate, and no further treatment was applied. Subsequent cardiovascular screening, including echocardiography, cervical artery ultrasound and bilateral lower extremity vascular ultrasound, was performed, and all the findings were negative. Four days after the femur fracture, the patient presented with moderate dyspnea, and her arterial blood gas analysis retrieved a pH value of 7.4. PO2 was 35 mm Hg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 126 mm Hg, and arterial oxygen saturation was 97.5% under nasal oxygen. Fourteen days after the fracture, both the lung symptoms and lung CT findings were considerably improved (Fig. B). Transthoracic echocardiography ultrasound was performed again, and shunts through a PFO were observed (Fig. ). On the following day, there was a gradual improvement in consciousness. However, the patients speech indicated dysphasia. Under active supportive care and hormone therapy, the patient was finally discharged with dysphasia and an untreated closed fracture.\n",

      "A 53-year-old man (height, 170 cm; weight, 89 kg) was admitted to the hospital because of a 1-year history of shortness of breath after exercise. The patient was a smoker, had a history of hypertension, and was taking captopril and nimodipine. Breathing was reduced in the left lung. However, neither rhonchus nor moist rales were heard during auscultation. Chest computed tomography revealed a GEB, and the left lung was compressed by about 95% with a right mediastinal shift (). An electrocardiogram showed normal findings, and echocardiography revealed that the heart was located in the right thoracic cavity. The left ventricular diastolic function was decreased, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was 64%. Laboratory tests showed no obvious abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis showed the following: pH: 7.43, PaCO2: 41 mmHg, PaO2: 94 mmHg, lactate: 1.4 mmol/L, potassium: 3.6 mmol/L, sodium: 138 mmol/L, calcium: 1.10 mmol/L, FiO2: 21%, and SpO2: 98%.\n",
      "On the day of surgery, the patient’s electrocardiogram, blood pressure, SpO2, and bispectral index were monitored upon entry into the operating room. A radial artery catheter and right internal jugular venous catheter were placed. The patient’s arterial blood pressure was 175/109 mmHg, heart rate was 90 beats/minute, and SpO2 was 94%. Before anesthesia, 40 µg of dexmedetomidine was infused within 10 minutes. The thoracic surgeon then created a small incision at the intersection of the sixth intercostal space and the left mid-axillary line to puncture the lung bulla and insert an indwelling catheter (14 Ga, 16 cm in length; Arrow International/Teleflex, Wayne, PA, USA) into the GEB to drain it for 15 minutes. The patient was preoxygenated with 100% oxygen at 6 L/minute for 5 minutes. Anesthesia was administered using 100 mg of propofol, 30 µg of sufentanil, and 50 mg of rocuronium. A 37-Fr right double-lumen endotracheal tube was inserted with the help of a visual laryngoscope, and single-lung ventilation was performed after proper alignment had been confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The tidal volume was set at 5 to 6 mL/kg, the respiratory rate was 15 to 17 breaths/minute, the positive end-expiratory pressure was set at 5 cmH2O, and the inhalation:expiration ratio was 1:2. Propofol, remifentanil, and sevoflurane were used to maintain anesthesia. The intraoperative bispectral index was maintained at 40 to 50. After resecting the GEB (), one-lung ventilation was switched to two-lung ventilation and the lungs slowly expanded with a low tidal volume until complete lung re-expansion was observed. During the 3-hour surgery, the patient experienced 50 mL of blood loss, was administered 1300 mL of lactated Ringer’s solution, and excreted 500 mL of urine. After the operation, the double-lumen endotracheal tube was replaced with a single-lumen endotracheal tube and the patient was sent to the intensive care unit for monitoring and further treatment. Two hours after entering the intensive care unit, the patient was fully awake and the tracheal tube was smoothly removed. The following day, the patient was transferred to the thoracic surgery ward, where he recovered; he was discharged 12 days later. Postoperative chest computed tomography showed that the lungs were well inflated with no abnormalities ().\n",

      "A 24-year-old man, a newly appointed automobile mechanic, presented to the emergency room of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital with a chief complaint of progressive shortness of breath, low-grade fever, bilateral chest pain, and nonproductive cough for three days. The shortness of breath was exertional, and the patient did not complain of any orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or pedal edema. The low-grade fever occurred three days before dyspnea, had a Tmax of 99.8°F, was on and off, and was not associated with chills or rigors. There was no history of wheezing, sputum production, hemoptysis, night sweats, weight loss, or anorexia. He denies any rash, joint pain, numbness, or weakness in the extremities. On detailed inquiry, he revealed that he recently started working as an automobile mechanic and had to aspirate diesel from fuel tanks often. As he was new to this job, he had accidentally aspirated a small volume of diesel several times in the last two weeks. He was a nonsmoker and had never consumed alcohol in his lifetime. The patient had no past medical history of note, no history of allergies, and had not taken any drugs or medications recently.\n",
      "On examination, he was ill-looking with a temperature of 98°F, a sphygmomanometric blood pressure of 140/90mmHg, a heart rate of 110 beats/minute, and a respiratory rate of 28/minute saturating poorly in ambient air (peripheral SpO2 87%, as measured by pulse oximetry). He had no pallor, icterus, lymphadenopathy, cyanosis, clubbing, edema, and dehydration. There was a decreased excursion of the chest wall on chest examination, diminished breath sounds bilaterally along with diffuse bilateral basal crepitations, and a dull stony percussion note bilaterally. The examination of other systems did not reveal any abnormalities. The patient had leukocytosis with a total WBC count of 13900/mm3, and differential leukocyte count consisted of 90% neutrophils and 10% lymphocytes. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count were normal. Renal function test, liver function test, coagulation assay, and serology tests were regular. Arterial blood gas analysis was within the reference range.\n",
      "Chest X-ray (CXR) done at admission (Figure ) showed pneumonic consolidation over the bilateral lung field with bilateral pleural effusion and pneumothorax. Chest tubes were inserted bilaterally under ultrasound guidance to alleviate pleural effusion and pneumothorax. On the second day of chest tube insertion, CXR (Figure ) was done again, revealing the left lung's expansion, persistent right-sided pneumothorax, and bilateral surgical emphysema. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of thorax revealed right-sided pneumothorax, bilateral pleural effusion, bilateral patchy consolidated lung parenchyma, and bilateral chest tube in situ.\n",
      "Owing to radiological findings, clinical features, and siphonage history, the diagnosis of hydrocarbon pneumonitis was made. Since Nepal is a tuberculosis endemic region, pulmonary tuberculous was also considered as alternative diagnosis. However, sputum examination did not reveal the acid-fast organism; neither did the GeneXpert PCR test. The patient was kept under intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam, nebulization was done six hourly, and high flow oxygen was administered. The patient developed no complications during his hospital stay. The patient was discharged after two weeks when there was significant radiological regression of consolidations (Figure ), improvements in pulmonary symptoms, and maintenance of oxygen saturation above 90% in room air. The patient was advised to follow-up regularly and is doing well at the time of writing.\n",

      "A fit, physically active 32-year-old female with no underlying risk factors underwent a left knee anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and partial lateral meniscectomy. She was not taking oral contraceptives. She presented 19 days postoperatively with acute dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia, and complaints of feeling light-headed of 5 days duration. In the emergency department, she had sinus tachycardia on electrocardiography, a heart rate of 126 bpm, blood pressure of 107/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18/min, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Her examination was noted to be otherwise unremarkable. There was no evidence of surgical site infection and no limb swelling noted. A complete blood count and electrolyte and metabolic panel were normal. Her troponin was 80 ng/L (normal 0–14 ng/L). A chest radiograph and D-dimer were not performed. Her pretest probability of pulmonary embolism was moderate based on Wells' criteria [].\n",
      "Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) reported the patient as having PTE. Findings included saddle PE, extensive clot extending into lobar and segmental branches of all lobes () as well as evidence of right heart strain with marked right atrial (RA) and RV dilation as well as flattening and deviation of the interventricular septum.

      "A 39-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency room for the evaluation of jaundice. He complained of fever for the last seven days that was associated with nausea, intermittent headache, and dry cough. He also had diffuse arthralgia. The patient took over-the-counter antipyretic and analgesic but did not get any relief. The initial evaluation revealed a temperature of 100°F, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The physical examination showed severe jaundice with the icteric sclera. He had diffuse arthralgia with tenderness. Cardiac and chest examination was normal. The abdomen was soft with normal bowel sounds and no organomegaly.\n",
      "Initial laboratory analysis is shown in Tables and 2. The patient’s platelet count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were within the normal ranges, except white blood cells. His serum metabolic panel was unremarkable, except for elevated total bilirubin and creatinine.\n",
      "Extensive workup for severe jaundice involved serum iron studies, cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibody, and antinuclear antibody (ANA), all of which were negative. Common causes of hyperbilirubinemia such as hepatitis A, B, and, C were negative. His low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 50 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was 55 mg/dL, serum cholesterol was 180 mg/dL, and serum triglyceride was 152 mg/dL.\n",
      "On abdominal ultrasound, the liver, gall bladder, and spleen were normal in size and texture. CT of thorax and abdomen was performed, which revealed diffuse pulmonary and hilar infiltrates in both lung bases. It was suspected that the patient had a possible chest infection, and he was started on intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam. The patient’s kidney function was concerning due to high creatinine, but creatinine improved to 2.0 mg/dL on the third hospital day.\n",
      "On further investigation, the patient reported that he visited Connecticut, USA, one week ago. He had no history of tick bite. Peripheral smear examination of blood was performed, which revealed no abnormality in the morphology of blood cells. Serologic tests for Lyme disease were performed. He was treated with doxycycline at a dose of 100 mg twice a day on the third hospital day. The radiograph of the joints revealed no abnormality.\n",
      "His total bilirubin remained high during the hospital stay in the beginning, and his bilirubin was 12.0 mg/dL (direct: 10.3 mg/dL) on the third hospital day (Figure ). His white blood cell count remained elevated at 18 × 103/µL. However, his liver enzymes remained normal (Figure ).\n",
      "The patient’s fever resolved on hospital day 4, and joint pain also got better. Repeat ultrasound of the abdomen was conducted due to the worsening of laboratory results, which revealed no mass or calcification, except few changes in liver echotexture suggesting the possible fatty/fibrotic change.

      "An 81-year-old woman with a history of Graves’ disease, treated with both levothyroxine 50 µg and thiamazole 5 mg, was diagnosed with stage IIIB malignant mesothelioma in 2017. She underwent chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed for 10 courses. As disease progression was observed during chemotherapy, nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) was initiated in October 2018. In January 2019, after the eighth course of nivolumab treatment, the patient underwent laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy for sigmoid colon cancer. During the perioperative period, nivolumab administration was continued. Just after the surgery, she noted mild intermittent abdominal pain, which continued for 2 months. An abdominal CT scan was performed but showed no causative abnormalities, even at the surgical sites. Two weeks later, just after the 12th course of nivolumab, the patient visited an emergency department and complained of worse abdominal pain and general fatigue.\n",
      "On physical examination, her level of consciousness was normal, and her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 88/77 mm Hg, pulse rate 115 beats per minute, SpO2 95% on ambient air, respiratory rate 16 per minute, and body temperature 37.2°C. Even after infusion of 1.5 litres of intravenous physiologic saline, her blood pressure remained around 100/80 mm Hg. Vasopressor drugs were not used. Abdominal examination showed tenderness in the right lower quadrant without signs of peritoneal irritation. The physical examination was otherwise normal.\n",

      "A 65-year-old female, known case of metastatic breast cancer with brain involvement, presented to our emergency department because of dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia and hypotension since 2 hours ago.\n",
      "She had history of triple positive (ER+, PR+, HER2+) breast cancer and left radical mastectomy 15 years ago after which systemic chemotherapy and hormone therapy (Letrozole/Tamoxifen) was implemented. Three years before current presentation, bilateral hystero-salpingo-ovoforectomy, was performed. About 2 months ago, routine clinical examination by her oncologists revealed left axillary lymphadenopathy (2 × 3 cm) with fixed, firm and nontender node and an additional fixed mass (1 × 3 cm) in the anterior left forearm. Both lesions were excisionally biopsied. Further Imaging showed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and multiple metastatic lesions in the liver & abdomen and chest. PET scan showed 2 metastatic lesions in brain.\n",
      "Pathologic examination of excised node revealed metastatic breast cancer (ER+/HER2+) and salvage chemotherapy with Paclitaxel 100 mg and Gemcitabin 1000 mg weekly plus Herceptin (Trastuzumab) 440 mg and Perjecta (Pertuzumab) 14 mg/kg tri weekly was initiated. One day after the first dose of Herceptin and Perjecta and the fourth dose of Gemcitabin and Paclitaxel, the right lower extremity swelling developed and subsequent Compression ultrasound and Doppler studies revealed acute extensive thrombus formation in the superficial femoral vein of the right leg. The patient was admitted and anticoagulation therapy with LMVH (60 mg BID) was initiated under the supervision of an oncologist at a private hospital. Preliminary laboratory tests revealed mild pancytopenia with a platelet count of 60 000 that was attributed to recent chemotherapy.\n",
      "Two days after anticoagulation initiation she was discharged home.\n",
      "Shortly after discharge, she presented to our emergency department with complaint of severe shortness of breath beginning abruptly 2 hours ago.\n",
      "Her vital signs upon arrival to the emergency department showed a systolic blood pressure of 70 mm Hg, a heart rate of 155 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 40 per minute & oxygen saturation of 70% in ambient air. She was apparently pale, agitated, diaphoretic and unable to speak in full sentence. Jugular veins were distended and cardiac exam showed moderate tachycardia and a right ventricular heave.\n",
      "Pulmonary examination was unremarkable except for decreased breath sounds at the mid-zone of the left lung and the base of right lung.\n",
      "Radial pulses were very weak bilaterally with no palpable pulse in lower extremities. The initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 135 per minute, right bundle branch block with a QRS duration of 130 ms and right axis deviation of 110 degrees (Figure ).\n",
      "Bedside echocardiography performed despite severe agitation of the patient demonstrated preserved EF (EF = 50%-55%), severe right ventricular (RV) dilation and estimated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 45-50 mm Hg.\n",

      "A 43-year-old man presented to the emergency department reporting sudden-onset feeling of palpitations and near syncope after strenuous heavy lifting. He was pale and diaphoretic; blood pressure was measured 90/70 mmHg, oxygen level 99%, heart-rate 210–230 b.p.m., and body temperature 36.6°C. Past medical history was clear for cardiac disease, syncope, or pre-syncope. No history of sudden cardiac death (SCD) or cardiomyopathy into his family was stated. He denied recent flu-like symptoms, smoking, illicit drug use, or excessive alcohol consumption. Physical examination was unremarkable. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) depicted an irregularly irregular, broad QRS complex tachycardia (). No previous ECG recordings were handed. Direct current (DC) cardioversion restored sinus rhythm with manifest ventricular pre-excitation and clear ‘delta’ waves () confirming our initial clinical suspicion for underlying WPW syndrome. Shortest pre-excited RR interval (SPERRI) during AF was estimated at 160 ms (), indicating an AP with extremely short antegrade effective refractory period (ERP) at risk for mediating SCD. Echocardiography ruled out abnormalities associated with WPW, including Ebstein’s anomaly, valve lesions, cardiac hypertrophy, atrial aneurysms, and septal defects. Cardiac ischaemia was also excluded on the basis of clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and laboratory data. The patient was put on enoxaparin 80 mg b.i.d. and propafenone 150 mg t.i.d. and his clinical course remained uneventful. Electrophysiological study (EPS) was performed at a tertiary centre on Day 10 post-diagnosis; programmed atrial stimulation induced pre-excited AF with markedly increased SPERRI = 264 ms and a left anterolateral AP with antegrade only conduction properties was ablated (). The patient was scheduled for routine cardiologic follow-up and advised to abstain from intense physical activity for at least 1-month post-discharge. In case of palpitations, ECG and 24-h Holter monitoring were suggested. CHA2DS2-VASc Score was calculated zero, so 1 month of rivaroxaban 20 mg daily was deemed sufficient post-ablation. Family members were also screened for pre-excitation. The patient remained symptom free without pre-excitation on surface ECG on his latest follow-up visit 3 months after the procedure.\n",

      "A 48-year-old non-smoking male, with past medical history of diabetes mellitus and aplastic anemia, was admitted to our hospital with fever, substernal chest pain and dyspnea of three-week duration. On examination, he was in mild respiratory distress. His vital signs were: temperature 38.8° C, pulse 92 bpm, respiratory rate 24 per minute, BP 115 / 64 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. He had right-sided chest dullness and crackles. The rest of his exam was negative. His medication included insulin and tacrolimus: 1 mg orally twice a day. His laboratory findings were: WBC 0.5×106/L, hemoglobin 79 g/l, platelets 9×106/L, glucose 13.7 mmol/l, sodium 125 mmol/l, bicarbonate 13 mmol/l, serum creatinine 143 micromol/l, INR 1.5, PT 13.3 sec. Cultures, including acid-fast bacilli, were negative. On his admission, chest x-ray showed a large round opacity adjacent to the right hilum []. Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of the chest confirmed the presence of a 9 × 9 cm mass, with air bronchograms, occupying most of the right upper lobe []. He was admitted with the working diagnosis of neutropenic fever and right upper lobe lung mass. He was started on broad antibiotic coverage with ceftazidime, vancomycin and caspofungin. The patient underwent transthoracic core biopsy of this mass, the histopathologic diagnosis was: pulmonary mucormycosis []. He was subsequently switched to intravenous liposomal amphotericin B therapy. His condition continued to deteriorate requiring transfer to the Intensive Care Unit for mechanical ventilation.

      "A 48-year-old non-smoking male, with past medical history of diabetes mellitus and aplastic anemia, was admitted to our hospital with fever, substernal chest pain and dyspnea of three-week duration. On examination, he was in mild respiratory distress. His vital signs were: temperature 38.8° C, pulse 92 bpm, respiratory rate 24 per minute, BP 115 / 64 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. He had right-sided chest dullness and crackles. The rest of his exam was negative. His medication included insulin and tacrolimus: 1 mg orally twice a day. His laboratory findings were: WBC 0.5×106/L, hemoglobin 79 g/l, platelets 9×106/L, glucose 13.7 mmol/l, sodium 125 mmol/l, bicarbonate 13 mmol/l, serum creatinine 143 micromol/l, INR 1.5, PT 13.3 sec. Cultures, including acid-fast bacilli, were negative. On his admission, chest x-ray showed a large round opacity adjacent to the right hilum []. Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of the chest confirmed the presence of a 9 × 9 cm mass, with air bronchograms, occupying most of the right upper lobe []. He was admitted with the working diagnosis of neutropenic fever and right upper lobe lung mass. He was started on broad antibiotic coverage with ceftazidime, vancomycin and caspofungin. The patient underwent transthoracic core biopsy of this mass, the histopathologic diagnosis was: pulmonary mucormycosis []. He was subsequently switched to intravenous liposomal amphotericin B therapy. His condition continued to deteriorate requiring transfer to the Intensive Care Unit for mechanical ventilation. His blood count never recuperated despite treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and repetitive transfusions. He died 12 days after admission.\n",

      "A 75-year-old woman, who was being treated with prednisolone 5 mg/day for polymyalgia rheumatica, presented with anorexia and general malaise for 3 days and then developed vomiting and diarrhea. She experienced difficulty moving her body, and her consciousness deteriorated. The patient was brought to our hospital on an ambulance. The consciousness level on admission, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation were E3V4M6, 39.5 °C, 153/88 mmHg, 124 beats/minute, 25 breaths/minute, and 90% (with oxygen mask 6 L/min), respectively. Her bulbar conjunctiva was congested on both sides, and coarse crackles were heard in the right lung field. Reticular dermatosis was found on both of her lower legs, and erythematous dermatosis was observed on the lower side of the back. Laboratory blood tests on admission showed elevated inflammatory markers (white blood cell count and C-reactive protein), creatine phosphokinase, and liver aminotransferase. Further, a rapid influenza diagnostic test was positive for influenza A (Table ). Chest computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse airspace opacification in the right middle lobe (Fig. ). Head CT demonstrated a slight fluid collection in the right upper sinus suggesting sinusitis.\n",
      "Her clinical signs and symptoms fulfilled three out of five clinical criteria of TSS with a fever of 38.9 °C or higher, diffuse erythroderma, and multisystem involvement (conjunctival congestion, gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, hepatic dysfunction, and disorientation). At this time point, she had not developed desquamation yet and had no hypotension. Therefore, the patient was clinically diagnosed with influenza with bacterial pneumonia and potential TSS, and her treatment was started with meropenem (1 g every 8 h), vancomycin (1 g every 12 h, therapeutic drug monitoring: ≥15 μg/mL), and clindamycin (600 mg every 8 h).\n",
      "The next day, S. simulans, a CoNS strain, was detected in both sets of blood cultures. Furthermore, pneumococci and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) were identified in sputum cultures (Geckler 4 group) and pharyngeal cultures (small number of colonies), respectively. Exotoxins, such as TSST-1, and staphylococcal enterotoxins (type A, B, C, and D), which are known to cause TSS, were not detected in culture samples of MSSA and S. simulans. We used the reversed passive latex agglutination method to evaluate the exotoxins and enterotoxins; the minimum detection sensitivity of sensitized latex using this method was found to be 1–2 ng/mL. We changed the antimicrobial therapy to cefazolin (1 g q8h) and clindamycin (600 mg q8h), based on microbiologic test results, and this therapy was administered for 14 days. Finger desquamation appeared on the 8th day of hospitalization, fulfilling four out of five clinical criteria for TSS. Therefore, we diagnosed the case as probable TSS.\n",
      "Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were high: neopterin 62 mmol/L (reference range, ≤5 mmol/L) and IL-6 38 pg/mL (reference range, ≤5 pg/mL). Lymphocyte subpopulation distribution was then analyzed in peripheral blood (Fig. ), showing prominent CD57 expression in CD8+ T cells, suggesting strong activation of this T lymphocyte subset.\n",
      "Furthermore, T cell receptor (TCR) Vβ repertoire distribution analysis was carried out (Fig. ). A specific subset of CD8+ T cells, including Vβ7.2 and Vβ14 cells, was increased, indicating the oligoclonal activation of CD8+ T cells likely due to antigen exposure.

The patient was suffering from a gait disorder which severely restricted her mobility without a wheelchair. A history of congestive heart failure and cerebral infarction was reported. The patient also had a 5-year history of lumbar nerve root and epidural blocks to manage her symptoms. MRI revealed multiple old compression fractures (T10–12, L2–4), vertebroplasty at T7, 10, 11, and L4 and spinal canal stenosis (severe central stenosis L1/2, bilateral mild foraminal stenosis T10–L1) (). On presentation, a fluoroscopy-guided epidural steroid injection was scheduled. In the prone position, the injection site was disinfected and 1% lidocaine was injected. The L5/S1 interspace was identified by fluoroscopy, and an 18-gauge Tuohy needle was advanced into the interlaminar space under an AP fluoroscopic view. The needle was advanced into the epidural space using the LOR technique with a 1-ml air-filled syringe though the LF and a location where the syringe would not rebound. However, CSF aspirated, and on injecting 0.5 ml of the contrast, a dural puncture was confirmed through the fluoroscopic AP and lateral images (). The procedure was aborted immediately. After explaining the occurrence of the dural puncture to the patient, she was sent to the recovery room. Her blood pressure was 103/61 mmHg, HR was 87 beats/min and oxygen saturation was 96%. Normal saline was infused intravenously and oxygen (5 L/min) was administered using a facial mask with a reservoir. One hour later, she complained of severe (NRS score 5–6) bilateral temporal headache and pain on the top of her head that persisted regardless of posture changes. Tramadol administration did not reduce her headache. A case of pneumocephalus was suspected. Brain CT examination showed the presence of air at the ventricular frontal horn, anterior interhemispheric fissure, right ambient cistern, and around bilateral cavernous sinuses (). The patient was admitted to the hospital after an explanation was provided to her and her guardian. After the admission, oxygen (5 L/min) was administered. Twenty-two hours later, the headache was reduced by 70%. Follow-up brain CT confirmed the reduction of the pneumocephalus. Therefore, she was discharged the next day. Follow-up 2 weeks after discharge, indicated complete resolution with no complaint of headache. Her physical examination was negative for pneumocephalus.\n",

      "Prior to COVID-19 vaccination becoming widely available, a previously healthy, 20-year-old Caucasian male with no significant past medical history presented with two weeks history of progressive dyspnea. About four days prior to presentation, he was evaluated at the emergency department with dyspnea, nonproductive cough, malaise, emesis, diarrhea, intermittent fever with a temperature max of 103°F, and found to have leukocytosis of 20,000 and negative COVID-19 test. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed bilateral interstitial patchy opacities and he was prescribed a five-day course of azithromycin for possible atypical pneumonia. He failed to improve after four days of treatment with azithromycin. He presented with worsening hypoxemia associated with fever, cough, emesis, and diarrhea.\n",
      "On presentation, vitals showed temperature of 100.8°F, heart rate 99, blood pressure 129/81, respiratory rate 40, SpO2 85% on room air which improved to >90% on 4L nasal cannula. The patient was not in respiratory distress and a physical exam showed crackles over right lung fields and left lingula with expiratory wheezes in the same distribution. Labs were significant for leukocytosis (18x10^3/uL) with eosinophilia (7%). CXR demonstrated diffuse bilateral airspace and interstitial opacity concerning for infection or inflammatory process including COVID-19 (Figure ). Azithromycin was continued and ceftriaxone was initiated for possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).\n",
      "The patient was placed in isolation for CXR findings, as mentioned above, which was concerning for COVID infection. Repeat testing for COVID came back negative. Further workup was significant for elevated ferritin 1,258 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 734 units/L, c-reactive protein (CRP) 27.20 mg/dL, procalcitonin 0.58 ng/mL suggestive of possible false-negative COVID-19 infection vs. CAP. Eosinophilic pneumonia vs. allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) was considered for eosinophilia and it was noted on initial complete blood count (CBC); further workup with IgE was unremarkable with 9.7 U/ml. Extensive infectious work up with influenza, mycoplasma, chlamydia nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), sputum culture, urine antigen testing for legionella, Histoplasma, blastomycosis, aspergillus all came back negative. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and QuantiFERON (QFT-G, Cellestis Limited, Carnegie, Vi Australia) were both negative.\n",
      "On further evaluation, the patient reported living in his parent’s basement around the time of dyspnea onset but denied being exposed to mold. He moved out to go to college within a few days of symptoms onset and he has been living with three housemates since then. The patient initially denied tobacco use, recreational drug use, or being sexually active, and later admitted to binge drinking and vaping (dapping, use of nicotine, and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products) once a week during social gatherings, and the last time he vaped was two days prior to the onset of dyspnea. The urine drug screen came back positive for cannabinoids.\n",
      "Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) acutely worsened while on empiric therapy for CAP requiring a high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with 35 to 45 L/min O2 and 0.4 to 0.6 FiO2, and he was started on treatment with methylprednisolone 40 mg every six hours and albuterol-ipratropium nebulizers. Infectious disease and pulmonology were consulted. Work up with CT chest demonstrated diffuse bilateral lower lobe predominant ground-glass opacities with relative sparing of the subpleural regions and associated interstitial thickening (Figure ). Suspicion of COVID infection remained high but he had a few more negative tests. An echocardiogram showed normal size lateral ventricles and normal systolic function with an ejection fraction of 63%; left pleural effusion was noted. AHRF improved significantly to 2L of nasal cannula after two days of receiving methylprednisolone. The patient was diagnosed with EVALI as a diagnosis of exclusion and AHRF resolved with steroid therapy.\n",
      "Infectious disease recommended discontinuing all antibiotics for low concern of infectious etiology. Pulmonology service recommended checking antinuclear antibodies (ANA), vasculitis panel with ANA, anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) for initial eosinophilia. All these labs were negative, and eosinophilia was later resolved. He underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy. Infectious work-up on the BAL sample was unremarkable for viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens and cytology demonstrated small clusters of atypical cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. The patient briefly required being on HFNC after bronchoscopy, but he was back on room air the third day after initiating methylprednisolone. Repeat CXR showed marked improvement in bilateral interstitial and soft tissue opacities (Figure ).\n",
      "The patient was hospitalized for a total of seven days, and he was discharged on prednisone 60 mg tapered dose over two weeks and supplementary oxygen (3 L of O2 with exertion). Five weeks after the hospital admission, the patient was evaluated at the pulmonary clinic for follow-up. He has been asymptomatic and AHRF has completely resolved.\n",

Eosinophilic pneumonia vs. allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) was considered for eosinophilia and it was noted on initial complete blood count (CBC); further workup with IgE was unremarkable with 9.7 U/ml. Extensive infectious work up with influenza, mycoplasma, chlamydia nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), sputum culture, urine antigen testing for legionella, Histoplasma, blastomycosis, aspergillus all came back negative. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and QuantiFERON (QFT-G, Cellestis Limited, Carnegie, Vi Australia) were both negative.\n",
      "On further evaluation, the patient reported living in his parent’s basement around the time of dyspnea onset but denied being exposed to mold. He moved out to go to college within a few days of symptoms onset and he has been living with three housemates since then. The patient initially denied tobacco use, recreational drug use, or being sexually active, and later admitted to binge drinking and vaping (dapping, use of nicotine, and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products) once a week during social gatherings, and the last time he vaped was two days prior to the onset of dyspnea. The urine drug screen came back positive for cannabinoids.\n",
      "Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) acutely worsened while on empiric therapy for CAP requiring a high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with 35 to 45 L/min O2 and 0.4 to 0.6 FiO2, and he was started on treatment with methylprednisolone 40 mg every six hours and albuterol-ipratropium nebulizers. Infectious disease and pulmonology were consulted. Work up with CT chest demonstrated diffuse bilateral lower lobe predominant ground-glass opacities with relative sparing of the subpleural regions and associated interstitial thickening (Figure ). Suspicion of COVID infection remained high but he had a few more negative tests. An echocardiogram showed normal size lateral ventricles and normal systolic function with an ejection fraction of 63%; left pleural effusion was noted. AHRF improved significantly to 2L of nasal cannula after two days of receiving methylprednisolone. The patient was diagnosed with EVALI as a diagnosis of exclusion and AHRF resolved with steroid therapy.\n",
      "Infectious disease recommended discontinuing all antibiotics for low concern of infectious etiology. Pulmonology service recommended checking antinuclear antibodies (ANA), vasculitis panel with ANA, anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) for initial eosinophilia. All these labs were negative, and eosinophilia was later resolved. He underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy. Infectious work-up on the BAL sample was unremarkable for viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens and cytology demonstrated small clusters of atypical cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. The patient briefly required being on HFNC after bronchoscopy, but he was back on room air the third day after initiating methylprednisolone. Repeat CXR showed marked improvement in bilateral interstitial and soft tissue opacities (Figure ).\n",
      "The patient was hospitalized for a total of seven days, and he was discharged on prednisone 60 mg tapered dose over two weeks and supplementary oxygen (3 L of O2 with exertion). Five weeks after the hospital admission, the patient was evaluated at the pulmonary clinic for follow-up. He has been asymptomatic and AHRF has completely resolved.\n",

      "A 59-year-old female presented to the ED with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. Her abdominal pain began three hours before presentation and had awoken her from sleep. This abdominal pain was described as “achy,” 5/10, intermittent, and located in the left lower quadrant without radiation. She denied nausea or vomiting and had no diarrhea or blood in her stools. Review of systems revealed that the patient had symptoms of dysuria for one day and left-sided flank pain along with her abdominal pain. She denied fevers or chills. She stated that, despite taking her prescribed insulin injections, her blood sugars have been persistently elevated above 400 with her personal glucometer. Her past medical history was significant for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and prior cerebrovascular accident. She denied ever having any surgeries. She used regular insulin, Lantus (insulin glargine), and Ibuprofen. Her family history was noncontributory, and she denied alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use.\n",
      "Physical exam revealed a temperature of 36.5° C, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 166/81 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 99% on room air, and capillary blood glucose of 447 mg/dL. She was awake, alert, and interacting appropriately. Her pupils were equally round and reactive to light. The cardiac exam was normal and lungs were clear with breath sounds bilaterally. The abdomen was soft with minimal tenderness to palpation in the left periumbilical and left lower quadrant. There was no guarding or rebound. Extremities were warm and well-perfused. The neurological exam revealed no deficit.\n",
      "The metabolic panel revealed sodium of 132 mEq/L (normal 135–145), BUN of 45 mg/dL (normal 8–22), Creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL (normal 0.5–1.3), glucose of 473 mg/dL, and an anion gap of 8.0. A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/MM3 (normal 4.5–11.0) and a manual differential with 10.10 K/MM3 Neutrophils (normal 0.80–7.70). The hepatic panel was remarkable for an alkaline phosphatase of 189 U/L (normal 35–115). The urine was visibly clear and non-turbid. Urinalysis was leukocyte esterase and nitrate negative, but revealed large occult blood, glucosuria, protein of 300 mg/DL, and 3–6 WBC/HPF (normal 0–3).\n",
      "While laboratory studies were pending, the patient received one liter IV normal saline, four mg of morphine sulfate IV for pain, and 10 units of regular insulin. Despite fluid administration and analgesia, the patient continued to have worsening 6/10 abdominal pain. Given the patient’s presentation of undifferentiated abdominal pain without clear etiology and her immunocompromised state, a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was ordered. The CT scan revealed significant air in the bladder wall and lumen consistent with EC, severe left hydroureter and hydronephrosis without evidence of stones, and significant left perinephric stranding without gas in the renal parenchyma ().\n",
      "A gram of Ceftriaxone and 500 mg of Gentamycin were started empirically along with a repeat fluid bolus and placement of a Foley catheter.

Her heart rate was persistently tachycardic (in the 130s), and she developed a fever to 39.4°C. In light of developing urosepsis and the potential for rapid progression to Emphysematous pyelonephritis, Interventional Radiology (IR) was consulted and placed a left nephrostomy tube to relieve the functional obstruction of the urinary tract just eight hours after the patient presented to the ED. After nephrostomy tube placement by IR, the patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. The urine culture grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae and the patient was continued on IV antibiotics. Three days after admission, the nephrostomy tube was removed as the patient was able to void without use of a foley catheter and was able to control her pain.

Chest CT angiography demonstrated a proximal ascending aorta dissection. The patient was transferred to our tertiary medical centre and admitted to the cardiac surgery department. Since she came from an endemic area, she was tested for COVID-19 infection by RT-PCR testing of a nasopharyngeal swab, which came back positive. The cardiac surgeons postponed surgery, asked the patient to avoid mobilization, and kept her blood pressure low by administering intravenous labetalol. Physical examination upon arrival at the intensive care unit was notable for an oral temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 72 beats/min, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, blood pressure of 106/55 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94% in room air. Laboratory tests showed no leucocytosis, D-dimer blood levels of 7,353 ng/ml, and CRP blood levels of 129 mg/l. Another chest CT angiogram showed no change in the aortic dissection. The patient was not treated with thromboprophylaxis because of the high risk of aortic rupture and bleeding, but a pneumatic compression device on both legs was used in order to prevent deep vein thrombosis.\n",

      "A 26-year-old female presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of dyspnea and left precordial pain of 6 hr duration. She had no history of exertional dyspnea, fever, weight loss, prolonged immobilization, syncope, focal neurological deficits, substance abuse, endocrine disorders and dermatological ailments in the past. She had no family history of cardiac disorders, including cardiac tumors. The patient's physical examination revealed blood pressure of 94/60 mmHg, heart rate of 120 beats/min, respiratory rate of 40/min, elevated jugular venous pressure with prominent ‘v’ wave. On cardiovascular system examination, S1 was normal, S2 was narrowly split with loud P2; a pan-systolic murmur of grade III/VI intensity was present along left sternal border. Tumor plop was audible. Chest was clear on auscultation. Abdominal examination was normal. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, right axis deviation and QR in V1 lead. Pulse oximetry revealed a saturation of 85% at room air increasing to 90% with 100% oxygen at 6 L/min. Laboratory examination revealed hemoglobin - 12.6 g/dl, total leukocytes count - 12.600/µL and platelet count of 1,00,000/µL. Liver function tests and renal function tests were normal. Chest roentgenogram was unremarkable.\n",
      "Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a large pedunculated mobile mass in RA with heterogenous echotexture attached to RA free wall and another mass attached to interatrial septum near fossa ovalis []. Another mass was seen in RV measuring 11 mm × 11 mm just beneath the septal leaflet of tricuspid valve []. Larger RA mass was prolapsing into RV producing severe eccentric TR jet with a gradient of 60 mmHg [, supplementary movie 1]. RV outflow tract and PA was dilated []. Inferior vena cava was free of any mass or thrombus (supplementary movie 2). HRCT thorax revealed embolization to the lateral aspect of right PA and along the medial aspect of left PA causing subtotal obstruction with pulmonary infarct in left lung [Figure and ]. Ultrasonography of abdomen and bilateral lower limb Doppler was unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen was normal.\n",
      "Once the diagnosis of multicentric RA and RV myxoma with tumor fragment embolization to PA was made, emergency surgery was performed by standard median sternotomy and cardio-pulmonary bypass using bicaval and ascending aortic cannulation to prevent further embolic events. Systemic hypothermia was used, and cardioplegia was administered for myocardial protection. The RA was then opened and a round lobulated mass measuring 3 cm × 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm was found attached to the RA free wall by a pedicle. Another mass attached to interatrial septum near fossa ovalis was excised. Multiple degenerating tumor strands were detected in RA, which were not visualized by transthoracic echocardiography. Another solitary mass was excised from the RV originating beneath the septal leaflet of tricuspid valve [Figure and ]. After the direct closure of RA, patient was weaned off the extra-corporeal circulation.\n",
      "Gross pathological examination revealed multiple flesh-colored soft to firm lobulated mass. Gross foci of degeneration were detected. Microscopy revealed hypocellular tumor tissue with myxoid background, isolated spindle and stellate cells with no abnormal mitosis or pleomorphism [Figure and ]. Gross pathology and histopathological examination were consistent with the diagnosis of cardiac myxoma.\n",
      "After the surgical excision of the tumor, severity of TR decreased from severe to mild. Her breathlessness decreased. Patient was administered anticoagulation therapy postsurgery. Echocardiographic follow-up at 6 months revealed no recurrence.\n",

      "Mrs. A.O., a 40-year-old known SCD patient with hemoglobin SS genotype was referred to the pulmonary division on account of dry cough of 3 weeks, difficulty in breathing of 2 weeks, and bilateral leg swelling of 4 days. There was low-grade fever, no weight loss, and no contact with chronic cough index. Difficulty in breathing initially occurred on exertion but later occurred even at rest. There was orthopnea but no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. There was bilateral leg swelling, which worsened progressively. No swelling in other parts of the body. No reduction in her urine volume. She was not a diagnosed asthmatic, hypertensive, or diabetic and she was not previously treated for tuberculosis or any other chronic lung diseases. She was only admitted for childbirth in her adulthood years. She had a single episode of blood transfusion when she was 6 years old. Afterwards, she has been crisis free for more than 20 years. She neither smokes cigarettes nor consumes alcoholic drinks. No history of exposure to cigarette smoke from others. She is married in a monogamous family with two girls and one boy. Her last childbirth was 15 years prior to presentation. She works as a secretary in the registration office of a state polytechnic. No history of exposure to occupational dust or fumes. No history of chronic drug use and no history of allergy.\n",
      "On general examination, she was a middle aged looking woman, conscious, dyspneic with central cyanosis, afebrile (Temperature=36.5), not pale, anicteric, not dehydrated, grade 3 digital clubbing, bilateral pitting pedal edema up to the lower third of the leg, weight=84 kg, height=1.65 m, and BMI=30.9 kg/m2. Oxygen saturation in room air was 78% and this increased to 92% on 5 L/min of oxygen via nasal prong.\n",
      "Respiratory examination revealed that she was in respiratory distress as evidenced by respiratory rate of 42/ min, flaring of alae nasi, and use of accessory muscles of respiration, and the trachea was central with symmetrical chest movement. Percussion note was resonant with coarse crepitations over the entire right lung and posterior lower zone of the left lung.\n",
      "Cardiovascular examination: pulse=100 beats/min, regular with premature beats, full volume; arterial wall was not thickened. No locomotor brachialis. BP was 105/60 mmHg. JVP was raised to the angle of the jaw. She had a right parasternal heave and apex beat was in the 5th left intercostal just lateral to the mid-clavicular line. Heart sounds were S1, S2, S3 gallop rhythm with loud pulmonary component of second heart sound.\n",
      "Abdomen – full, moves with respiration, liver was 4 cm below the costal margin, mildly tender, smooth surface, and span of 16 cm. Spleen and kidneys were not enlarged. No demonstrable ascites.\n",
      "Other systems were within normal limits.\n",
      "Her packed cell volume was 32% with a white blood cell count of 13.5 ×109/L (neutrophil=52%, lymphocyte=38%, other=9%) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 3 mm/h. Sputum examination for acid and alcohol fast bacilli was negative in three samples; sputum culture did not yield any growth. Chest X-ray showed widespread reticulonodular opacities involving the whole of the right lung field and left upper zone with an area of hyperluscency in the left mid and lower zones. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia of 120 beats/min, P pulmonale, and right ventricular hypertrophy with ventricular extrasystole. Echocardiography demonstrated tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary hypertension. Spirometry showed severe restrictive pattern {FVC=1.13 L (36% of predicted); FEV1=0.84 L (35% of predicted) FEV1/FVC ratio=74.5% (92% of predicted)}. Chest CT demonstrated diffuse ground glass opacity with thickening of interlobar septa in the entire right lung field as well as left apex and part of the left lower region. There were multiple bullae with reduced attenuation (suggestive of compensatory emphysema of the remaining lung tissue) in the left lung field, sparing the apex.

      "She was admitted and managed initially in the intensive care unit with intranasal oxygen, cardiopulmonary monitoring, tablet levofloxacin 500 mg daily, intravenous frusemide 60 mg 8 hourly, tablet spironolactone 25 mg twice daily, and tablet aspirin 75 mg daily.\n",
      "The heart failure gradually improved but she continued to desaturate in room air. She was advised on domiciliary oxygen, which she initially rejected but later purchased a cylinder of oxygen (did not purchase oxygen concentrator because of poor power supply) and pulse oximeter. She was discharged home, on 1–3 L/min of domiciliary oxygen (to be titrated with the pulse oximeter readings), aspirin, and oral diuretics, after 1 month of hospitalization. She was re-admitted 1 week later with productive cough and features of right heart failure. She was managed with oxygen, diuretics, antibiotics, and aspirin.

      "Our patient is an otherwise previously healthy, active, nonsmoking, 40-year-old male who presented to an outside hospital on April 2, 2020, with a 7-day history of fevers (Tmax: 102.7°F, 39.3C) and worsening shortness of breath. On presentation, he was saturating 80% on room air, which improved to 96% with 6 l of the nasal cannula. His other vitals at presentation included: heart rate of 87 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, the temperature of 39.1C, and blood pressure of 135/60 mmHg. His height was 188 cm, weight 87.7 kg, and body mass index was 25. His C-reactive protein (CRP) was 19.8 mg/dL (normal: 0.3–1.0 mg/dL). Other admission laboratories included a point of care troponin (normal, 0.0 ng/ml), creatinine of 1.17 mg/dL, carbon dioxide of 27 mmol/L, procalcitonin of 0.31 ng/ml, lactic acid of 1.5 mmol/L, normal liver transaminases, normal prothrombin time, white blood cell count (8.9 10^9/L) and differential, hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL. No D-Dimer or brain natriuretic peptide testing was performed and per the initial assessment, since there were no complaints of leg swelling, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was not performed, however, a chest X-ray demonstrated “multi-focal consolidation most consistent with typical viral bronchopneumonia” []. No other source of bacterial infection or cause of acute respiratory failure was identified, and a COVID polymerase chain reaction test was positive. He required mechanical ventilation (initial setting: rate: 24/min; positive end-expiratory pressure: 14 mmHg; peak inspiratory pressure: 31 mmHg; tidal volume: 460 ml; FIO2: 0.70) the following day with a CRP of 23.6 mg/dL and a ferritin of 1039 ng/mL (normal: 38–380 ng/mL). His COVID-19 therapies are listed in . D-Dimer testing on April 9th was elevated to 5.25 mg/L.\n",
      "However, due to the worsening of his respiratory failure, including poor response to prone positioning and inhaled nitric oxide (40 parts/million), he was transferred to our institution for ECMO on April 7, 2020 []. On arrival, he was immediately assessed by our ECMO Team (respiratory ECMO survival prediction score: 3, Class II risk, 76% predicted survival)[] and placed on percutaneous veno-veno ECMO at the bedside (21 Fr single-stage inflow, 25 Fr multi-stage drainage cannulas with Maquet CardioHelp circuit (Maquet Cardiovascular, Wayne NJ USA). ECMO was initiated 96 h postinitiation of mechanical ventilation. At the time of cannulation, his arterial PaO2 to FiO2 (P/F) ratio was 45. He was treated with tocilizumab on April 11, and the following day, an additional unit of convalescent plasma was given. Neither he did receive remdesivir, nor did he receive steroids. Systemic heparin for the ECMO circuit was used with a target partial thromboplastin time of 40–60 s. A lung-protective strategy was employed using an airway pressure release ventilation mode that was frequently adjusted to minimize airway pressures and atelectasis.\n",
      "He was successfully decannulated on April 15, 2020 (189 h on ECMO) and was extubated to the nasal cannula by April 17 with a P/F ratio of 213.\n",
      "He was discharged home with his family on April 21, 2020, on room air []. His COVID-19 test (Cepheid Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay) on the day before discharge was still positive, and he was advised to self-isolate. His only medication at discharge was apixaban 5 mg po BID for a peroneal deep-vein thrombosis discovered post-ECMO.\n",
      "Formal pulmonary function testing was obtained on May 6, 2020 [] and reported no abnormalities. The final interpretation was: “no evidence of obstruction, restriction, or diffusion impairment.” Outpatient COVID-19 testing was negative. The patient reported no respiratory symptoms, was walking and eventually running at least 6 miles a day and was encouraged to pursue more intensive exercise as tolerated (of note, the patient was an avid marathon runner before his illness). As he has been doing well, not further chest imaging has been performed. Although no family member tested positive for the disease, his wife tested positive for antibodies, suggesting she had been infected previously. However, she never required hospitalization or treatment and never manifested significant clinical signs or symptoms.\n",

      "The patient was a 52-year-old man who referred to the Poursina Hospital in Rasht while complaining of abdominal pain from the day before hospitalization. The patient reported a history of tiredness, fever, and nausea. In the examinations performed, there was a brief tenderness in the patient’s epigastrium. The patient’s initial pressure was 80.120 with a pulse rate of 95. The patient’s fever was not detected upon arrival. For the patient, an upright abdominal radiograph, abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds, and blood tests including CBC,BUN,Cr,PT,PTT,INR,LFT,Amylase,Lipase,LDH were requested.\n",
      "The patient’s upright abdominal radiograph was normal. Perihepatic and perisplenic fluid and gallstones were seen on the patient’s ultrasound. On laboratory findings, White Blood Cells (WBC) = 4000 /μL with 30% lymphocytes were reported. Hemoglobin (Hb) = 11 g/dL and Platelets (PLT) = 245,000 /μL were found. Other findings were normal. No pathological lesion was observed on the patient’s lung CT scan (Fig. ). A small amount of perihepatic and perisplenic fluid was observed on the patient’s CT scan (Fig. ).\n",
      "The patient was monitored and about 12 h after hospitalization, ill appearance, respiratory (respiratory distress) symptoms, and high fever were reported for the patient. The patient’s O2Sat was 96%. Due to the exacerbation of the patient’s respiratory symptoms, the CT scan of the lungs was requested again for the patient and the tests were repeated for suspicion of coronavirus.\n",
      "The second CT scan was performed about 18 h after the initial examination. Patchy ground-glass lesions along with bilateral pleural effusion were seen on the CT scan of the patient’s lungs (Fig. ). A bilateral chest tube was inserted for the patient according to the volume of the fluid, and according to the patient’s CT scan and respiratory symptoms, he was transferred to the specialized COVID-19 unit. In the new blood tests, Hb = 9.5 g/dL, WBC = 4800/μL, and PLT = 195,000 /μL were observed. An extensive fluid collection around the spleen was observed on the CT scan performed for the patient (Fig. ). The examination of the patient’s abdomen changed significantly about 20 h after the initial examination and became generalized rebound tenderness. However, the patient’s blood pressure was still 70.110 and the pulse rate was 90. According to the examination, the patient was immediately transferred to the operating room and underwent laparotomy. During the operation, contrary to our expectations, a lot of blood (about 1000 cc) was observed in the patient’s abdomen. After blood suctioning, the left upper quadrant was bleeding and the rupture of the spleen could also be observed. Therefore, a splenectomy was performed (Fig. ).\n",
      "In the examinations performed for the patient, the patient’s PCR confirmed COVID-19. The patient was admitted to the ICU after surgery, and within 3 days after surgery, the patient was extubated. The patient’s chest tubes were removed within 1 week after the surgery according to the radiographs performed. After a concomitant treatment for COVID-19 and during a two-week hospital stay, the patient was discharged in good general condition.\n",
      "During the examinations performed and the history taken several times from the patient and the patient’s companion, no history of the trauma was given and the changes in the patient’s CT scan and the patient’s examinations occurred very quickly.\n",
      "The LE cell, ANA, and HIV as well as the Monospot, RF and Wright agglutination test were negative. The peripheral blood smear and the Widal agglutination test were negative for malaria and VCA Antibody IgM and IgG were negative for Epstein - Barr virus (EBV).\n",
      "In the macroscopic study of splenic pathology, a spleen tissue with dimensions of 11× 8 × 5 cm and a weight of 350 g and a laceration with a size of 2 × 2 cm were observed and in the microscopic study, a focally hemorrhagic area was reported.\n",

      "The patient was monitored and about 12 h after hospitalization, ill appearance, respiratory (respiratory distress) symptoms, and high fever were reported for the patient. The patient’s O2Sat was 96%. Due to the exacerbation of the patient’s respiratory symptoms, the CT scan of the lungs was requested again for the patient and the tests were repeated for suspicion of coronavirus.\n",
      "The second CT scan was performed about 18 h after the initial examination. Patchy ground-glass lesions along with bilateral pleural effusion were seen on the CT scan of the patient’s lungs (Fig. ). A bilateral chest tube was inserted for the patient according to the volume of the fluid, and according to the patient’s CT scan and respiratory symptoms, he was transferred to the specialized COVID-19 unit. In the new blood tests, Hb = 9.5 g/dL, WBC = 4800/μL, and PLT = 195,000 /μL were observed. An extensive fluid collection around the spleen was observed on the CT scan performed for the patient (Fig. ). The examination of the patient’s abdomen changed significantly about 20 h after the initial examination and became generalized rebound tenderness. However, the patient’s blood pressure was still 70.110 and the pulse rate was 90. According to the examination, the patient was immediately transferred to the operating room and underwent laparotomy. During the operation, contrary to our expectations, a lot of blood (about 1000 cc) was observed in the patient’s abdomen. After blood suctioning, the left upper quadrant was bleeding and the rupture of the spleen could also be observed. Therefore, a splenectomy was performed (Fig. ).\n",
      "In the examinations performed for the patient, the patient’s PCR confirmed COVID-19. The patient was admitted to the ICU after surgery, and within 3 days after surgery, the patient was extubated. The patient’s chest tubes were removed within 1 week after the surgery according to the radiographs performed. After a concomitant treatment for COVID-19 and during a two-week hospital stay, the patient was discharged in good general condition.\n",
      "During the examinations performed and the history taken several times from the patient and the patient’s companion, no history of the trauma was given and the changes in the patient’s CT scan and the patient’s examinations occurred very quickly.\n",
      "The LE cell, ANA, and HIV as well as the Monospot, RF and Wright agglutination test were negative. The peripheral blood smear and the Widal agglutination test were negative for malaria and VCA Antibody IgM and IgG were negative for Epstein - Barr virus (EBV).\n",
      "In the macroscopic study of splenic pathology, a spleen tissue with dimensions of 11× 8 × 5 cm and a weight of 350 g and a laceration with a size of 2 × 2 cm were observed and in the microscopic study, a focally hemorrhagic area was reported.\n",

She had had hypertension for five years for which she was being treated with lisinopril but had been noncompliant for over three years because of financial constraints. The patient denied any alcohol or illicit drug use and was a lifelong non-smoker.\n",
      "On admission, her blood pressure was 102/66 mm/Hg, her temperature was 37°C, her respiratory rate was 24 breaths/minute, her oxygen saturation level was 92% on room air and her pulse rate was 88 beats/minute. A physical examination revealed an ill-looking woman with mucosal pallor, generalized wasting and non-tender, rubbery axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. There was no evidence of cyanosis, digital clubbing, pitting edema, skin rash or joint deformities. Her abdomen was mildly distended but non-tender, with no organomegaly detected. Dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left base were noted on the respiratory system examination. The cardiovascular and neurological examinations were unremarkable.\n",
      "Initial laboratory investigations (Table ) revealed anemia, leukopenia, elevated blood urea nitrogen and elevated serum creatinine. Urinalysis showed trace proteinuria. Chest radiography revealed bilateral pleural effusions that were determined to be exudative in nature on the basis of thoracocentesis. There was a high index of suspicion for malignancy; however, the results of chest, abdomen and pelvis computed tomography scans and an axillary lymph node biopsy did not confirm this. Human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculin skin tests were negative.\n",

The patient was subsequently restarted on Rivaroxaban® and discharged. He presented again 5 days later with left arm weakness and was found to have multiple areas of punctuate infarctions of both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, more confluent within the right frontal lobe on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain ( and ). He has been compliant with his Rivaroxaban® since the previous hospital discharge 5 days prior. The patient was admitted and subsequently started on unfractionated heparin. On admission, his vital signs were blood pressure 138/93, heart rate 65 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed regular rate and rhythm, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops and clear lungs on auscultation. Neurologic examination revealed intact cranial nerves, preserved strength in all extremities with an exception of mild dysmetria in the left upper extremity and an NIH score of 1. Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, non-specific ST changes, and a premature ventricular contraction. Transthoracic echocardiogram was notable for normal left ventricular function with mild tricuspid regurgitation and stage 1 diastolic dysfunction. Transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for intracardiac thrombus. The echocardiography with agitated saline contrast revealed microbubbles of moderate opacity entering the left atrium from the left lower pulmonary vein indicative of a grade 2 intra-pulmonary arteriovenous shunt (). There was no atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale. Unfractionated heparin was continued, and the patient was transferred to a tertiary care center for embolization of the shunt. There, he developed recurrent cerebral infarctions while anticoagulation was temporarily held. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was done for persistent abdominal pain, and noted an omental mass, and subsequent exploratory laparotomy revealed an adenocarcinoma within the omentum with nodular peritoneal implants.

      "A 21-year-old woman presented to the ED with complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. Prior to arrival to the ED she had an episode of near syncope. Her previous medical history included development of diffuse erythematous rash following a course of minocycline prescribed for acne three months prior to ED presentation. The minocycline was discontinued, and she was treated with 30 milligrams (mg) daily oral prednisone with improvement of the rash. Initial vitals included blood pressure of 81/68 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), heart rate of 121 beats per minute (bpm), and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. She was afebrile (36.7ºC oral temperature) and had pulse oximetry (SpO2) of 100% on room air. Physical exam was within normal limits. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed right bundle branch block and normal ST-T segments, but no previous ECG was available.\n",
      "While in the ED the patient had an episode of syncope during peripheral venous catheter placement, and intravenous (IV) fluids were administered due to concern of vasovagal event. She was also administered 5 mg IV dexamethasone due to possibility of adrenal suppression from steroid use. Her systolic pressure improved. However, the patient complained of worsening chest pain and then became unresponsive with pulseless electrical activity arrest (PEA). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and Advanced Cardiac Life Support were initiated. She received two doses of 1 mg IV epinephrine with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in normal sinus rhythm of 70 bpm and blood pressure of 72/48 mmHg. Due to persistent hypotension, norepinephrine infusion was administered with improvement of blood pressure to 88/56 mmHg. She was intubated for airway protection.\n",
      "Due to concern for massive pulmonary embolus, computed tomography chest angiography was performed but was unremarkable. Point-of-care echocardiogram demonstrated no right heart strain and grossly reduced heart function. Telemetry demonstrated QRS widening and increasing bradycardia to 41 bpm. The patient then developed a second PEA arrest with ROSC after CPR and one dose of 1 mg IV epinephrine. She remained hypotensive with blood pressure of 60/40 mmHg despite norepinephrine infusion. Initial troponin-T measured was 8.56 nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL) (reference range 0.0–0.02 ng/mL) and complete blood count with differential showed leukocytosis of 17.5 × 103 cells/mL (reference range 4.0–10.0 × 103 cells/mL) and eosinophilia of 1.6 × 103 cells/mL r (reference range 0.0–0.4 × 103 cells/mL). The cardiology service was consulted and a formal echocardiogram demonstrated a severely reduced ejection fraction of 15% (normal range 55–70%).\n",
      "The dermatology service was also consulted at bedside in the ED; concern for ANEM in setting of DRESS given the rapidity of onset of her cardiac dysfunction was discussed. Also, the differential diagnoses included coronary vasculitis, viral myocarditis, infiltrative cardiomyopathy, and sepsis. (She was administered 4.5 g piperacillin/tazobactam and 20 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) vancomycin, and 500 mg azithromycin IV.)\n",
      "While in the ED the patient developed further hypotension with blood pressure of 61/40 mmHg despite multiple vasopressors (IV vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions) and had severe acidemia and hypoxemia despite high ventilator support. Ventilator settings were tidal volume of 360mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 20 centimeters of water (cmH2O), and fraction of inspired oxygen of 100%, and respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. Arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed respiratory acidosis with pH of 7.06, carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) of 78 mmHg (reference range 33–43 mmHg), low arterial oxygen (PaO2) of 61 mmHg (reference range 80–100 mmHg), and normal bicarbonate. Basal metabolic panel was within normal limits. Due to continued decline, she received cannulation for veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) within the ED. ECMO cannulation occurred within three hours of initial cardiac arrest. Once placed on ECMO she had significant improvement in her acidosis and hypoxemia on repeat ABG (pH 7.39, pCO2 41 mmHg, PaO2 135 mmHg) and was rapidly weaned from her vasopressors.\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) for further management. Due to concern of DRESS-induced myocarditis, dexamethasone with a dose of 1 mg/kg/day was administered intravenously. On hospital day (HD) eight, cardiac biopsy demonstrated diffuse active myocarditis with coagulative myocyte necrosis and mixed infiltrate including eosinophils consistent with DRESS myocarditis. She was decannulated from ECMO on HD 16. She was eventually discharged after 20 days in the ICU and 62 total days in the hospital with a life vest and continued cardiac follow-up. An echocardiogram performed three months later demonstrated improved ejection fraction of 34%.\n",

      "Due to concern for massive pulmonary embolus, computed tomography chest angiography was performed but was unremarkable. Point-of-care echocardiogram demonstrated no right heart strain and grossly reduced heart function. Telemetry demonstrated QRS widening and increasing bradycardia to 41 bpm. The patient then developed a second PEA arrest with ROSC after CPR and one dose of 1 mg IV epinephrine. She remained hypotensive with blood pressure of 60/40 mmHg despite norepinephrine infusion. Initial troponin-T measured was 8.56 nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL) (reference range 0.0–0.02 ng/mL) and complete blood count with differential showed leukocytosis of 17.5 × 103 cells/mL (reference range 4.0–10.0 × 103 cells/mL) and eosinophilia of 1.6 × 103 cells/mL r (reference range 0.0–0.4 × 103 cells/mL). The cardiology service was consulted and a formal echocardiogram demonstrated a severely reduced ejection fraction of 15% (normal range 55–70%).\n",
      "The dermatology service was also consulted at bedside in the ED; concern for ANEM in setting of DRESS given the rapidity of onset of her cardiac dysfunction was discussed. Also, the differential diagnoses included coronary vasculitis, viral myocarditis, infiltrative cardiomyopathy, and sepsis. (She was administered 4.5 g piperacillin/tazobactam and 20 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) vancomycin, and 500 mg azithromycin IV.)\n",
      "While in the ED the patient developed further hypotension with blood pressure of 61/40 mmHg despite multiple vasopressors (IV vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions) and had severe acidemia and hypoxemia despite high ventilator support. Ventilator settings were tidal volume of 360mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 20 centimeters of water (cmH2O), and fraction of inspired oxygen of 100%, and respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. Arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed respiratory acidosis with pH of 7.06, carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) of 78 mmHg (reference range 33–43 mmHg), low arterial oxygen (PaO2) of 61 mmHg (reference range 80–100 mmHg), and normal bicarbonate. Basal metabolic panel was within normal limits. Due to continued decline, she received cannulation for veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) within the ED. ECMO cannulation occurred within three hours of initial cardiac arrest. Once placed on ECMO she had significant improvement in her acidosis and hypoxemia on repeat ABG (pH 7.39, pCO2 41 mmHg, PaO2 135 mmHg) and was rapidly weaned from her vasopressors.\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) for further management. Due to concern of DRESS-induced myocarditis, dexamethasone with a dose of 1 mg/kg/day was administered intravenously. On hospital day (HD) eight, cardiac biopsy demonstrated diffuse active myocarditis with coagulative myocyte necrosis and mixed infiltrate including eosinophils consistent with DRESS myocarditis. She was decannulated from ECMO on HD 16. She was eventually discharged after 20 days in the ICU and 62 total days in the hospital with a life vest and continued cardiac follow-up. An echocardiogram performed three months later demonstrated improved ejection fraction of 34%.\n",

      "A 79-year-old African American female presented to the emergency room for shortness of breath with exertion and grade 2+ bilateral lower limb edema. The patient denied dizziness, palpitation, fever, chills, productive cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, melena, and hematochezia.\n",
      "On examination, the patient's blood pressure was 94/66 mmHg, the temperature was 97.6 °F, the heart rate was irregular with a rate of 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and she was saturating 100% on room air. Sinus pauses were noted, up to 10 seconds in length, on the telemetry monitor. ECG and telemetry monitoring demonstrated SSS with sinus bradycardia, pauses up to three seconds, and atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rate of 130 beats per minute (bpm; Figure ). Her other medical history included paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, lower extremity venous insufficiency, diastolic heart failure (ejection fraction of 70-75%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, and no other medical history reported. The patient's home medications included fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhaler, albuterol sulfate inhaler, torsemide, metolazone, potassium chloride, vitamin D3, pantoprazole, sotalol, and no other heart rate modulating medication reported. Laboratory workup revealed a potassium of 4.5 (3.5-5.1 mM/L), magnesium of 2.3 (1.7-2.7 mg/dL), thyroid-stimulating hormone of 1.54 (0.34-5.60 µIU/mL), and troponin of 0.1 (0.0-0.5 ng/mL). The patient underwent urgent pacemaker placement to prevent further sinus pauses.\n",
      "The patient was also complaining of dysphagia and difficulty swallowing, for which an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed. The procedure identified both esophageal and duodenal ulcers. The biopsy was performed during the EGD and sent for histopathological review. The esophagus contained small columnar pieces of mucosa and collections of eosinophilic, amorphous material demonstrated on congo red staining. The congo red stain contained one fragment with blood vessels that exhibited mural deposition of amyloid. In the duodenal biopsy, the lamina propria also had amyloid on congo red staining. Videofluoroscopic swallowing examination revealed no tracheal aspiration and no motility disorder. Eventually, the patient required percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement for feeding secondary to dysphagia. TTE findings were consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy, raising the possibility of cardiomyopathy secondary to amyloidosis and SSS as the initial presenting feature in our patient.\n",
      "The patient had also developed a bifascicular block, which was potentially consistent with an infiltrative amyloid disease. The patient had a Kappa free light chain drawn, and this was markedly elevated at 146 mg/dL (reference range 0.3-1.9 mg/dL), Lambda 1.97 (0.5-2.6 mg/dL), with a Kappa/Lambda ratio of 74.1. We performed electrophoresis to investigate further and found an elevated gamma globulin of 1.75 g/dL (reference range 0.70-1.50 mg/dL).\n",
      "Two months later the patient presented with persistent, progressive shortness of breath on minimal exertion and persistent lower limb edema.

      "A 57-year-old woman presented to the rheumatology clinic with recurrent fever and painful ulcers on her legs since two months. Eight months prior to current presentation, she developed vertigo and decreased hearing in her left ear which she felt was “full of air” all the time. She was found to have sensorineural deafness in her left ear. Two weeks later, she developed fever with chills. A chest radiograph revealed infiltrates in her right lung and an elevated ESR. She was treated with oral antibiotics which relieved her symptoms. Then she developed gingival hypertrophy and a CT scan of the paranasal sinuses revealed subcutaneous soft tissue thickening of the right buccal area suggestive of an inflammatory process. She was treated with ibuprofen and felt better. Her past medical history was notable for hypothyroidism for 20 years and she as well was maintained on 50 mcg of thyroxin daily. She had undergone hysterectomy for uterine fibroids 15 years ago. She reported no recent travel history. Of note, she revealed contact with sick animals. She nursed her paralyzed pet dog and also had cats. She was treated with antibiotics yet continued to spike fever and came to our center for comprehensive evaluation. On examination, she appeared weak and ill. The temperature was 37.5°C, the blood pressure 139/69 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, with 99% oxygen saturation at room air. Erythematous tender nodules were noticed on bilateral lower extremities ().\n",
      "The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Her complete blood count revealed normocytic, normochromic anemia with normal white cell and platelet count. Her biochemistry showed normal kidney and liver function. No active sediment was present on urinalysis. Her three sets of blood cultures and one urine culture reported no growth. The test for latent tuberculosis by interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) was also negative. Serology for Brucella abortus and melitensis also came negative. Tests for chronic viral hepatitis B and C were also normal. Serological tests for connective tissue disease were negative as was the serum angiotensin converting enzyme level. Other relevant investigations are outlined in . An upper abdominal ultrasound showed hypoechoic, cystic lesions scattered across both lobes of the liver (). A subsequent CT scan of the abdomen with contrast showed multiple oval hypoattenuating lesions in both lobes of the liver ().\n",
      "On liver biopsy there was evidence of cholestasis and multiple large irregular areas of necrosis, palisaded by epitheloid cells with associated granulomatous inflammation with a number of plasma cells ().\n",
      "Acid-fast bacilli culture of liver biopsy specimen after six weeks came out negative. Meanwhile, the patient continued to spike fever with maximum temperature of 101°F. Leg lesions were becoming worse with central necrosis and purulent discharge (Figures and ).\n",
      "Pus cultures were negative for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial growth. A biopsy of the skin was performed. Pathological examination of frozen sections revealed surface ulceration with fibrinoid necrosis and vasculitis involving superficial and deep dermal vessels along with granuloma formation, neutrophilic infiltration, and debris ().\n",
      "Immunohistochemical testing was performed on biopsy specimen using immune-alkaline phosphatase technique which came negative for mycobacterial species. Real-time PCR for mycobacterial species also turned out to be negative. It was concluded from the skin biopsy that the patient had cutaneous granulomatous vasculitis. Treatment was commenced with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day and the patient was offered induction with cyclophosphamide which she refused due to associated toxicities. Meanwhile, azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day was added to prednisone. After seven weeks on prednisone and six weeks of azathioprine her lesions had healed almost completely (). She was maintained on prednisone 5 mg bid and azathioprine 50 mg bid with healing lesions. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen revealed normal architecture of hepatic parenchyma.\n",
      "Therefore, considering a chronic inflammatory process characterized by hearing loss, gingival hypertrophy, granulomatous hepatic lesions, and cutaneous ulcers with necrotizing granulomatous inflammation on skin biopsy, a unifying diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) was made.\n",

She had undergone hysterectomy for uterine fibroids 15 years ago. She reported no recent travel history. Of note, she revealed contact with sick animals. She nursed her paralyzed pet dog and also had cats. She was treated with antibiotics yet continued to spike fever and came to our center for comprehensive evaluation. On examination, she appeared weak and ill. The temperature was 37.5°C, the blood pressure 139/69 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, with 99% oxygen saturation at room air. Erythematous tender nodules were noticed on bilateral lower extremities ().\n",
      "The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Her complete blood count revealed normocytic, normochromic anemia with normal white cell and platelet count. Her biochemistry showed normal kidney and liver function. No active sediment was present on urinalysis. Her three sets of blood cultures and one urine culture reported no growth. The test for latent tuberculosis by interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) was also negative. Serology for Brucella abortus and melitensis also came negative. Tests for chronic viral hepatitis B and C were also normal. Serological tests for connective tissue disease were negative as was the serum angiotensin converting enzyme level. Other relevant investigations are outlined in . An upper abdominal ultrasound showed hypoechoic, cystic lesions scattered across both lobes of the liver (). A subsequent CT scan of the abdomen with contrast showed multiple oval hypoattenuating lesions in both lobes of the liver ().\n",
      "On liver biopsy there was evidence of cholestasis and multiple large irregular areas of necrosis, palisaded by epitheloid cells with associated granulomatous inflammation with a number of plasma cells ().\n",
      "Acid-fast bacilli culture of liver biopsy specimen after six weeks came out negative. Meanwhile, the patient continued to spike fever with maximum temperature of 101°F. Leg lesions were becoming worse with central necrosis and purulent discharge (Figures and ).\n",
      "Pus cultures were negative for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial growth. A biopsy of the skin was performed. Pathological examination of frozen sections revealed surface ulceration with fibrinoid necrosis and vasculitis involving superficial and deep dermal vessels along with granuloma formation, neutrophilic infiltration, and debris ().\n",
      "Immunohistochemical testing was performed on biopsy specimen using immune-alkaline phosphatase technique which came negative for mycobacterial species. Real-time PCR for mycobacterial species also turned out to be negative. It was concluded from the skin biopsy that the patient had cutaneous granulomatous vasculitis. Treatment was commenced with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day and the patient was offered induction with cyclophosphamide which she refused due to associated toxicities. Meanwhile, azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day was added to prednisone. After seven weeks on prednisone and six weeks of azathioprine her lesions had healed almost completely (). She was maintained on prednisone 5 mg bid and azathioprine 50 mg bid with healing lesions. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen revealed normal architecture of hepatic parenchyma.\n",
      "Therefore, considering a chronic inflammatory process characterized by hearing loss, gingival hypertrophy, granulomatous hepatic lesions, and cutaneous ulcers with necrotizing granulomatous inflammation on skin biopsy, a unifying diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) was made.\n",

      "A 55-year-old man with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and depression developed pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath, and had a syncopal episode during a car trip from Texas to Cleveland. In the emergency room (ER), his blood pressure was 120/83 mmHg, pulse 119/min, respiratory rate 22/min, temperature 36.6oC, and oxygen (O2) saturation was 93% on room air. Physical exam was notable for an obese male in no acute distress with tachycardia, regular rhythm, clear lungs, shallow breaths without accessory muscle usage, and mild epigastric tenderness. His electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 117 bpm with a deep S wave in lead I, a small Q wave and inverted T wave in lead III (Figure ).\n",
      "Initial laboratory testing was significant for serum sodium 132 mmol/L, creatinine 1.6 mg/dL, ProBNP 3188pg/mL, and initial troponin 0.12, peaking at 0.2 on hospital day two. Computed tomography (CT) chest showed bilateral submassive pulmonary emboli in multiple branches of the right and left upper and lower lobe pulmonary arteries, with no indication of a saddle embolus or main pulmonary artery thrombus (Figures -).\n",
      "The patient was started on an intravenous (IV) heparin drip and thrombolytics were deferred due to perceived hemodynamic stability and timing of presentation. While in the ER, he became more tachycardic with heart rate 130-140 bpm, and developed jugular venous distention and acute hypoxemia requiring 3 liters (L) nasal cannula to maintain normal O2 saturation. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to possible signs of acute decompensation.\n",
      "In the MICU, ultrasound revealed a right popliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT); an inferior vena cava filter was considered, but the patient was considered hemodynamically stable and placement of a filter was deferred. Over the second and third hospital days, he remained tachycardic at 105-130/min with blood pressures in the 110/80 mmHg range and stable O2 saturations on 3L per nasal cannula. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed right ventricular strain and a mobile structure in the right atrium, possibly consistent with thrombus. On hospital day four, he remained hemodynamically stable but experienced mild pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. On hospital day five, the patient was switched from IV heparin to enoxaparin 120 mg twice daily with a two-hour overlap; he was noted to have a transient O2 desaturation but remained normotensive. In the early hours of day six, he became diaphoretic and developed sustained tachycardia at 140/min with a blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg. He then developed chest pain and worsening dyspnea and lethargy, and was found to be in atrial flutter with 2:1 block. In the early afternoon, while speaking with the medical team and later while working with physical therapy, the patient complained of worsening shortness of breath, and was noted to be diaphoretic and persistently tachycardic at 120/min. Shortly thereafter, he lost consciousness and was found to be in cardiac arrest.

      "A 42-year-old African American female who recently emigrated from the Caribbean Islands initially presented with non-resolving productive cough and dyspnea for two weeks. She had no significant past medical history, no history of medication use, no history of surgery, or recent prolonged immobilization. Admission vitals were: blood pressure (BP) 110/75, temperature 98.2 F, respiratory rate 18/min, sPO2 95% room air, tachycardia with 110-120 beats/min. She was anxious on presentation. Rest of the physical exam including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory system findings, were unremarkable.\n",
      "Initial investigations revealed the following: White blood cell count 9.9 x 109/L (ref 4-11 x 109/L), hemoglobin 11.7 gm/dl (reference 13-15 gm/dl), hematocrit 36.8% (reference range 39-48%), platelets 304,000/ml (reference 15,000 to 450,000/ml); arterial blood gas analysis suggested hypoxia, pO2 being 72% and had high A-a gradient of 37 mm Hg (normal 5-10 mm Hg); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated to 508 unit/L (reference range 140-280 units/L). Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia. CT angiogram chest did not show any pulmonary embolus but showed diffuse ground glass lung opacities with hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure ). She underwent voluntary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing as per New York State law, and the test came back reactive with CD4 count 46 cells/micro litre (reference range 500-1500 cells/micro litre) and HIV viral load 810231 copies/ml (reference range 40-50 copies/ml). The urine legionella antigen was negative. Treatment was initiated with oral Bactrim DS and Prednisone (for suspected Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia [PCP]), and further investigation by bronchoscopy specimen was positive for Pneumocystis carinii PCR confirming PCP. The patient improved clinically and was discharged home with continuation therapy of Bactrim DS and outpatient follow-up instructions. However, she was re-admitted to the hospital within a week of discharge with worsening dyspnea and cough with expectorations. Vitals showed sinus tachycardia with heart rate 110/min. Other vitals like BP, temperature, respiratory rate were normal. Chest X-ray on admission showed perihilar opacities unchanged from previous admission (Figure ). Physical examination revealed rales bilaterally. The rest of examinations, including gastrointestinal, neurological, cardiovascular system, were normal. Treatment was initiated with broad spectrum antibiotics Vancomycin and Meropenem intravenous (IV) in view of possible superadded bacterial infection. On day 2 of admission, she complained of severe epigastric pain radiating to back and also was noted to have pruritic macular rashes over face and neck. As initial suspicion was Varicella Zoster (VZ) infection vs. drug-induced rash, Bactrim was stopped, and she was started on Valacyclovir orally. Serum lipase and amylase were elevated at 160 IU/dl (reference range less than 50 IU/dl) and 133 IU/dl (reference range less than 110 IU/dl) respectively. The rest of the labs, including blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, were normal. She was also started on IV hydration with isotonic normal saline and pain management with opioids for pancreatitis. Her clinical condition continued to worsen gradually, and the rash became more generalized with pruritic vesicular-papular eruptions. She developed a low-grade fever and became hypotension - BP 70/40 (she required inotropic support with norepinephrine for three days). Other systemic organs were also involved, as evident by laboratory abnormalities. Over the course of hospital stay, her labs got worsened significantly - platelet counts dropped remarkably (125-66-30---26---24); Lipase/amylase continued to increase (160/133-379/663---254/491); liver functions worsened with aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) gradually increased (180/128---389/227---837/501) (reference range < 40 for both); LDH was high (2438---2565-1308); lactic acid increased (3.7-2.4) [reference range < 2 mmol/L]. Given the worsening clinical status, she was switched to Acyclovir 500 mg IV. Her blood culture and urine culture sent on admission day returned negative for any bacterial infection; four days later, her VZ virus DNA PCR from skin blister and serum both reported positive confirming active VZV infection.\n",
      "Ultrasound abdomen did not reveal any gallstones. Echocardiogram did not suggest any source of septic emboli.\n",
      "Her clinical condition improved gradually with near normalization of labs. She completed 14 days course of antimicrobials for disseminated varicella. Eventually, she was started on an anti-retroviral drug Stribild (Dolutegravir/Lamivudine) daily along with a prophylactic dose of Dapsone (for PCP). Post treatment completion, oral Valacyclovir was initiated for viral suppression. After the acute stay in hospital for three weeks, she recovered well and was followed up regularly in the clinic with no further recurrence in six months of follow-up.\n",

Admission vitals were: blood pressure (BP) 110/75, temperature 98.2 F, respiratory rate 18/min, sPO2 95% room air, tachycardia with 110-120 beats/min. She was anxious on presentation. Rest of the physical exam including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory system findings, were unremarkable.\n",
      "Initial investigations revealed the following: White blood cell count 9.9 x 109/L (ref 4-11 x 109/L), hemoglobin 11.7 gm/dl (reference 13-15 gm/dl), hematocrit 36.8% (reference range 39-48%), platelets 304,000/ml (reference 15,000 to 450,000/ml); arterial blood gas analysis suggested hypoxia, pO2 being 72% and had high A-a gradient of 37 mm Hg (normal 5-10 mm Hg); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated to 508 unit/L (reference range 140-280 units/L). Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia. CT angiogram chest did not show any pulmonary embolus but showed diffuse ground glass lung opacities with hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure ). She underwent voluntary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing as per New York State law, and the test came back reactive with CD4 count 46 cells/micro litre (reference range 500-1500 cells/micro litre) and HIV viral load 810231 copies/ml (reference range 40-50 copies/ml). The urine legionella antigen was negative. Treatment was initiated with oral Bactrim DS and Prednisone (for suspected Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia [PCP]), and further investigation by bronchoscopy specimen was positive for Pneumocystis carinii PCR confirming PCP. The patient improved clinically and was discharged home with continuation therapy of Bactrim DS and outpatient follow-up instructions. However, she was re-admitted to the hospital within a week of discharge with worsening dyspnea and cough with expectorations. Vitals showed sinus tachycardia with heart rate 110/min. Other vitals like BP, temperature, respiratory rate were normal. Chest X-ray on admission showed perihilar opacities unchanged from previous admission (Figure ). Physical examination revealed rales bilaterally. The rest of examinations, including gastrointestinal, neurological, cardiovascular system, were normal.

      "A 38-year-old G2P2 African American woman presented with 3-hour duration of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Her pain was acute in onset and constant in nature, radiated to both groins, and was progressively worsening. She denied any musculoskeletal pain. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension, fibroid uterus, and a cholecystectomy. She had worsening menorrhagia over the past two months. Her last gynecologic evaluation was three years prior to presentation. She reported tobacco use and denied alcohol or drug consumption. Physical examination revealed diffuse rebound tenderness and a palpable abdominal mass. Initial vital signs were as follows: temperature of 38.6°C, heart rate of 122 beats per minute, blood pressure of 48/37, and respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 88% and increased to 94% on 2 liters of nasal oxygen.\n",
      "Biochemical testing showed an elevated white blood cell count (13.5 K/μL), significant neutrophilia (94.8%), an elevatedcreatinine (3.8 mg/dL), low hemoglobin (8.9 g/dL), low potassium (3.2 mEq/L), and an elevated myoglobin (2140 ng/mL, normal range: 0–101 ng/mL). A cardiac and skeletal muscle enzyme panel was normal. Baseline creatinine from a prior admission was normal (0.6 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed trace blood and amorphous sediment. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed a 24 cm × 13 cm × 13 cm complex mass occupying the pelvis and extending to the upper abdomen (). Both kidneys appeared normal in size without perinephric inflammation, hydronephrosis, or hydroureter. Renal sonography revealed normal echotexture and ureteral caliber.\n",
      "The working diagnosis was acute septic shock with associated acute renal failure. The patient had nonanion gap metabolic acidosis with a lactic acid level of 4.5 mmol/L (normal 0.4–2 mmol/L) and a pH of 7.40 with a compensatory decrease in PCO secondary to hyperventilation. Blood and urine cultures were obtained and the patient was started on intravenous fluid resuscitation, a bicarbonate drip, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. A norepinephrine infusion was used to maintain a normotensive state. The pelvic mass was thought to be the source of the patient's abdominal pain and represented a degenerating fibroid that was contributing to her critical presentation with worsening inflammation and myoglobinemia. Relevant tumor markers including CEA, AFP, CA-125, and inhibins A and B were normal.\n",
      "The patient's overall status continued to worsen the following day. She became obtunded with loss of consciousness, in sinus tachycardia, and hypotensive despite all aforementioned measures. Endotracheal intubation then followed. Furthermore, her renal function continued to deteriorate (creatinine of 7 mg/dL). Urine and blood cultures had still not yielded any bacterial growth. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated and the decision to perform an exploratory laparotomy and remove the pelvic mass followed, as it was attributed to the patient's worsening critical state.\n",
      "A large solitary fibroid was found within the left broad ligament that was densely adherent and contiguous with the uterus. The uterus and adnexal structures appeared significantly devitalized and edematous and were displacing the ureters without evidence of hydroureter. The bowels appeared normal. A total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed with an estimated blood loss of 150 mL. The patient remained intubated and returned to the surgical intensive care unit. The postoperative period was complicated by atrial fibrillation that responded to intravenous amiodarone in addition to anemia (Hg 6.7 g/dL) requiring blood transfusion.\n",
      "Dramatic biochemical improvement occurred over the next 48 hours with CRRT following surgery. Final blood and urine cultures were negative at 48 hours. Serum creatinine decreased to 1.4 mg/dL but however rebounded slowly over the following three days and peaked at 3.1 mg/dL. Serum myoglobin reached a nadir of 380.4 ng/mL by the fourth postoperative day (POD) and steadily increased and reached a plateau of 1074 ng/mL by POD-8 (). Clinical improvement followed with defervescence and normalization of vital signs by POD-3 and POD-5, respectively. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were discontinued at this time.

      "A 48-year-old diabetic male was referred to us with a diagnosis of basal VSR, approximately 2 weeks before MI. He had a history of breathlessness of New York Heart Association class III with bilateral pedal edema and oliguria for the past 15 days. On admission, he was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and heart rate of 110/min. He had elevated cardiac markers (troponin I of 0.1 ng/mL) with electrocardiogram showing Q waves in leads II, III avf showing evolved inferior wall (IW) and right ventricle (RV) MI. A two-dimensional echocardiography showed hypokinetic basal septum and a huge VSR [] of 18 × 20 mm in size shunting left to right [] with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (RV systolic pressure of 75 mmHg) and biventricular dysfunction and mild mitral regurgitation (MR) with an RV wall motion index (WMI) of 0.8. An elective coronary angiogram showed proximal tight occlusions of both the right coronary artery (RCA) and the obtuse marginal (OM) branch of the left circumflex. The left anterior descending artery was normal. He was planned for surgical closure of the VSR with grafts to OM and RCA territories after a week's time.\n",
      "A Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted after induction showing a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 24 mmHg, a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and diastolic pressure (DP) of 60 and 33 mmHg, respectively, and a diastolic pulmonary gradient of 9 mmHg. The central venous pressure (CVP) was 15 mmHg. Simultaneous right atrial and pulmonary artery saturations showed a step up of 30%. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was instituted with aorto bicaval cannulation and the heart was arrested by Del Nido cardioplegia (aortic root). After adequate retraction, a vertical left ventriculotomy was done parallel to the posterior descending artery (PDA) in the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. The VSR was visualized with difficulty by retracting the papillary muscle [] and its chordae tendinae. It was closed with bovine pericardium with interrupted 2-0 polypropylene sutures using David technique. The left ventriculotomy was closed [] followed by OM and PDA grafting as planned. After adequate period of CPB support with an aortic cross clamp time of 88 min and CPB time of 145 min, the patient was weaned off CPB. Transesophageal echo showed intact VSR patch with biventricular dysfunction. During closure, arterial pressures were 100/60 mmHg with a PASP of 45 and DP of 23 mmHg. The patient was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with supports of inj. dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min, inj. adrenaline 0.08 μg/kg/min, and inj. vasopressin 2 IU/h. As the cardiac contractility was reasonably alright, IABP was not inserted in the operation theater with a low threshold of insertion in case of eventuality.\n",
      "The patient was shifted to the ICU with continuous monitoring with cardiac output (CO) of 3.5 L/min and cardiac index (CI) of 1.9 L/min/m2 and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) of 1900 dynes-s/cm5. After 6 h, there was a drop in CO and SVR elevation, and hence a 40-cc IABP was inserted percutaneously through the right common femoral artery (CFA). The patient's hemodynamics improved and he was extubated on the second postoperative day (POD). As he was hemodynamically stable, on the fourth POD, IABP was removed with inj. dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min and inj. adrenaline 0.05 μg/kg/min. Six hours later, there was once again a drop in the CI and CO and echo showed severe RV dysfunction with a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) value of 8 mm. Inotropes were hiked with no further improvement. Twelve hours later, the patient became dyspneic, tachypneic with a mixed venous oxygen saturation (MVO2) of 35%, and a pulmonary vascular resistance of 250 dynes-s/cm5 and was electively re-intubated in view of hypoxia due to low cardiac output. A sheathless 34-cc IABP was re-inserted percutaneously through the left CFA. The hemodynamics improved and MVO2 improved to 70%. He was extubated the next day and a decision was made to retain the IABP. The IABP was removed after 10 days (1:1 augmentation for 8 days and 1:2 for the next 48 h and 1:3 for the next 24 h) and inotropes were reduced. Repeat echo showed improvement in the RV function with a TAPSE improving to 12 mm. He was discharged in a stable condition on 18th POD. Discharge echo revealed intact VSR patch [] with moderate biventricular dysfunctionand TAPSE value of 12 mm and moderate MR []. He is planned for MR follow-up and surgical intervention at a later date.\n",

The central venous pressure (CVP) was 15 mmHg. Simultaneous right atrial and pulmonary artery saturations showed a step up of 30%. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was instituted with aorto bicaval cannulation and the heart was arrested by Del Nido cardioplegia (aortic root). After adequate retraction, a vertical left ventriculotomy was done parallel to the posterior descending artery (PDA) in the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. The VSR was visualized with difficulty by retracting the papillary muscle [] and its chordae tendinae. It was closed with bovine pericardium with interrupted 2-0 polypropylene sutures using David technique. The left ventriculotomy was closed [] followed by OM and PDA grafting as planned. After adequate period of CPB support with an aortic cross clamp time of 88 min and CPB time of 145 min, the patient was weaned off CPB. Transesophageal echo showed intact VSR patch with biventricular dysfunction. During closure, arterial pressures were 100/60 mmHg with a PASP of 45 and DP of 23 mmHg. The patient was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with supports of inj. dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min, inj. adrenaline 0.08 μg/kg/min, and inj. vasopressin 2 IU/h. As the cardiac contractility was reasonably alright, IABP was not inserted in the operation theater with a low threshold of insertion in case of eventuality.\n",
      "The patient was shifted to the ICU with continuous monitoring with cardiac output (CO) of 3.5 L/min and cardiac index (CI) of 1.9 L/min/m2 and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) of 1900 dynes-s/cm5. After 6 h, there was a drop in CO and SVR elevation, and hence a 40-cc IABP was inserted percutaneously through the right common femoral artery (CFA). The patient's hemodynamics improved and he was extubated on the second postoperative day (POD). As he was hemodynamically stable, on the fourth POD, IABP was removed with inj. dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min and inj. adrenaline 0.05 μg/kg/min. Six hours later, there was once again a drop in the CI and CO and echo showed severe RV dysfunction with a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) value of 8 mm. Inotropes were hiked with no further improvement. Twelve hours later, the patient became dyspneic, tachypneic with a mixed venous oxygen saturation (MVO2) of 35%, and a pulmonary vascular resistance of 250 dynes-s/cm5 and was electively re-intubated in view of hypoxia due to low cardiac output. A sheathless 34-cc IABP was re-inserted percutaneously through the left CFA. The hemodynamics improved and MVO2 improved to 70%. He was extubated the next day and a decision was made to retain the IABP. The IABP was removed after 10 days (1:1 augmentation for 8 days and 1:2 for the next 48 h and 1:3 for the next 24 h) and inotropes were reduced. Repeat echo showed improvement in the RV function with a TAPSE improving to 12 mm. He was discharged in a stable condition on 18th POD. Discharge echo revealed intact VSR patch [] with moderate biventricular dysfunctionand TAPSE value of 12 mm and moderate MR []. He is planned for MR follow-up and surgical intervention at a later date.\n",

      "A 57-year-old white man presented with a 3-month history of new-onset, severe, bi-frontal headaches and a 13.6 kg (30-lb) weight loss. Local emergency room evaluation revealed a negative computed tomography (CT) scan of his head. Laboratory findings included an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 80 mm/hour and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 55.3 mg/L. He was discharged with pain control.\n",
      "During follow-up with his local primary provider, his headache persisted and bilateral jaw pain and left facial numbness had developed. He was started on prednisone 60 mg/day for presumed GCA with partial improvement in his headache. Bilateral temporal artery biopsies were performed 3 days later and were negative. Prednisone was subsequently discontinued. Two weeks later his headache progressed and right eye horizontal diplopia and perioral numbness developed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain was performed and interpreted as normal. He was admitted for pulse-dose steroids (1000 mg daily for 3 days) which led to resolution of visual symptoms and was discharged on prednisone 60 mg/day. Tapering below 50 mg/day was unsuccessful due to rising inflammatory markers, symptom progression, and return of diplopia. Severe left hip pain developed for which plain radiographs were obtained but negative for fracture or avascular necrosis.\n",
      "On referral to our institution he continued to have ongoing headache and left jaw numbness despite 6 weeks of high-dose glucocorticoids (80 mg/day). Left hip pain had worsened to the point of wheelchair dependency. His past medical history was remarkable for atrial fibrillation for which he was receiving warfarin 2 mg/day and diltiazem 240 mg/day. Social history was notable for lack of tobacco or alcohol use and absence of known environmental exposures during his employment as an office manager. Aside from prostate cancer in his father, our patient’s family history was negative for other pertinent diagnoses of additional malignancies or autoimmune conditions. Laboratory evaluation noted an ESR 72 mm/hour, CRP 53 mg/L, hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL, leukocytes 5.2 × 109/L and platelets 110 × 109/L, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.3, creatinine 1.04 mg/dL, calcium 11.6 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase 106 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 64 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 360 U/L, total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL, total protein 5.1 g/dL, and albumin 3.4 g/dL. Previously obtained autoimmune serologies were negative for antinuclear and extractable nuclear antigens as well as rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, myeloperoxidase, and proteinase-3 antibodies.\n",
      "His vital signs demonstrated a heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 94/44 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 12 per minute, oxygenation saturation of 96%, and weight of 144 kg with body mass index (BMI) of 48.6 kg/m2. An examination was notable for a Cushingoid appearance and morbid obesity. Evaluation of adenopathy and splenomegaly was limited due to body habitus. Pertinent cardiovascular findings included irregularly irregular pulse without murmurs. Upper and lower arterial pulses were normal and symmetric. Common superficial temporal artery palpation was without tenderness or nodularity. Trace pitting edema was noted to the ankle bilaterally. Breath sounds were equal and symmetric without wheezing or rhonchi. Aside from scattered bruising at site of venipuncture, no cutaneous abnormalities were noted. A neurologic examination showed normal speech without language deficits. Visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally. Cranial nerves 2–12 were assessed and normal except for mild esotropia of his right eye and hypoesthesia to light touch and pinprick over the left mandibular region of the left trigeminal nerve. The remaining dermatomes evaluated showed normal sensation. Reflexes were normal and symmetric throughout and toes were down-going bilaterally. No ataxia was observed. A musculoskeletal examination demonstrated normal range of motion of upper extremities without deficit. Marked pain was noted on passive and active range of motion of his left hip.\n",
      "Given the persistent headache despite high-dose glucocorticoids and atypical features, alternative etiologies were suspected. The local MRI of his brain was reviewed and evidence of abnormal enhancing soft tissue involving Meckel’s cave bilaterally with extension through the foramen ovale was noted (Fig. a). The differential diagnosis for infiltrative process in Meckel’s cave included sarcoidosis as well as primary or secondary neoplastic lesions such as meningioma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, schwannoma, neurofibroma, and lymphoma [, ]. The presence of constitutional symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers suggested a secondary process with associated intracranial involvement. As such, positron emission tomography (PET)-CT was obtained. This demonstrated extensive hypermetabolic lesions throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton, including the skull base, as well as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm (Fig. c). MRI of his left hip revealed diffusely abnormal marrow signal suggestive of infiltrative disease. A cervical lymph node biopsy demonstrated evidence of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and staging bone marrow biopsy revealed a hypercellular marrow (90%) with diffuse large B cell lymphoma involving 70% of the total cellularity (Fig. ). Initiation of high-dose methotrexate (3.5 g/m2), rituximab (375 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m2), hydroxydaunorubicin (50 mg/m2), Oncovin (vincristine; 2 mg), and prednisone (255 mg) (MR-CHOP; 21-day cycle) resulted in interval improvement in his headache and visual symptoms (Fig. b, d).\n",
      "Ten months after initial diagnosis and 4 months after completion of his sixth cycle of MR-CHOP, our patient re-presented with bilateral lower extremity weakness and PET-CT showed recurrence of disease with evidence of neurolymphomatosis of multiple cervical, thoracic, and sacral nerve roots. Intrathecal cytarabine (50 mg) was given and ibrutinib (140 mg/day) was initiated, resulting in initial findings of improved strength and subsequent decreased nerve root FDG-avidity.\n",

In the emergency department (ED), the patient was tachycardic at 120 beats per minute, hypoxic with oxygen 88% on room air, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) 3421 pg/ml, elevated troponins at 1.29 ng/ml, procalcitonin 25 ng/ml, lactic acid 5.0 mmol/L, white blood cells 19 K/UL, thrombocytopenia at 101 K/UL, and creatinine 1.91 mg/dL. Initial chest X-ray showed bilateral airspace opacities consistent with atypical pneumonia. The patient was intubated because he was in severe respiratory distress with use of accessory muscles and decreased oxygen saturation. Ventilator settings are presented in Table .\n",

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "The subject of this report is a 29 year old male, US citizen of Palestinian descent, who works full-time as a biomedical research technician. His health history is unremarkable, except for the fact that at age 16 he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Since then, he has been treated successfully with mesalamine (1.2 g, 2 times per day), azathioprine (50 mg, 3 times per day), and ursidiol (300 mg, 2 times per day). The subject has been able to live an active lifestyle and participate in a variety of sports including running, weightlifting, basketball, and baseball. The subject denies any history of smoking or use of alcohol, opioids, or illicit drugs. On April 22, 2020, the subject's father, who lives in the same house as the subject, and works for a major shipping company, was diagnosed with COVID-19. This was about 2 months after the first case of COVID had been confirmed in his state of residence, which was one of the early active zones of COVID-19 transmission in the US. On April 25, the patient began to experience general malaise and fatigue. Over the next 24 h, the symptoms worsened to include severe fatigue and weakness, loss of appetite, tiredness, slight dry cough, body aches, muscle pain, loss of taste and smell, sore throat and fever. The patient was then seen by his general practice physician. Vital signs at the time of examination were BP 110/72, pulse 97 BPM, respiration 14 per minute, oxygen saturation 98%, and body temperature 101.7°F. The patient was given a naso-pharyngeal swab, real-time RT-PCR test [COBAS (R) SARS-COV-@ test, Labcorp Laboratories, South Bend, IN] that confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19. In compliance with standard medical practice standards, the patient was ordered to self-isolate and to start a 5-day course of azithromycin (250 mg, daily), and to also take 1 g of paracetamol (acetaminophen) every 6 h for treatment of pain and fever. Despite good adherence to the recommended treatment, the symptoms other than fever, did not improve, and he also started to feel depressed, demotivated, and spend long periods in bed. During this period, the patient experienced ongoing generalized myalgia and musculoskeletal pain. He described the pain as persistent and relatively severe (rated 7 on a scale of 1–10). Because of this discomfort, after 4 days the patient decided to consume kratom to relieve his symptoms. According to the patient, he had first used kratom 14 months earlier before his COVID-19 infection. He used kratom sporadically (no more than 4–5 times in total) as a cognitive enhancer and not to self-treat pain.\n",
      "The patient decided to take 2.5 gms (or grams) of green kratom (as ground leaf powder suspended in water). The product was purchased at a local shop in April 2020 sold under the name “Green Bali.” After 30 min, he noticed a significant improvement in the intensity of the physical symptoms (mainly pain and fatigue), and within 60 min he felt a sensation of mild euphoria and well-being that lasted for about 5 h. After 6 h following consumption the effects of kratom wore off, and the patient administered another dose. He used kratom three times a day continuously for 3 days (for a total of 9 doses of 2.75 g each) with significant benefit.\n",

      "The subject of this report is a 29 year old male, US citizen of Palestinian descent, who works full-time as a biomedical research technician. His health history is unremarkable, except for the fact that at age 16 he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Since then, he has been treated successfully with mesalamine (1.2 g, 2 times per day), azathioprine (50 mg, 3 times per day), and ursidiol (300 mg, 2 times per day). The subject has been able to live an active lifestyle and participate in a variety of sports including running, weightlifting, basketball, and baseball. The subject denies any history of smoking or use of alcohol, opioids, or illicit drugs. On April 22, 2020, the subject's father, who lives in the same house as the subject, and works for a major shipping company, was diagnosed with COVID-19. This was about 2 months after the first case of COVID had been confirmed in his state of residence, which was one of the early active zones of COVID-19 transmission in the US. On April 25, the patient began to experience general malaise and fatigue. Over the next 24 h, the symptoms worsened to include severe fatigue and weakness, loss of appetite, tiredness, slight dry cough, body aches, muscle pain, loss of taste and smell, sore throat and fever. The patient was then seen by his general practice physician. Vital signs at the time of examination were BP 110/72, pulse 97 BPM, respiration 14 per minute, oxygen saturation 98%, and body temperature 101.7°F. The patient was given a naso-pharyngeal swab, real-time RT-PCR test [COBAS (R) SARS-COV-@ test, Labcorp Laboratories, South Bend, IN] that confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19. In compliance with standard medical practice standards, the patient was ordered to self-isolate and to start a 5-day course of azithromycin (250 mg, daily), and to also take 1 g of paracetamol (acetaminophen) every 6 h for treatment of pain and fever. Despite good adherence to the recommended treatment, the symptoms other than fever, did not improve, and he also started to feel depressed, demotivated, and spend long periods in bed. During this period, the patient experienced ongoing generalized myalgia and musculoskeletal pain. He described the pain as persistent and relatively severe (rated 7 on a scale of 1–10). Because of this discomfort, after 4 days the patient decided to consume kratom to relieve his symptoms. According to the patient, he had first used kratom 14 months earlier before his COVID-19 infection. He used kratom sporadically (no more than 4–5 times in total) as a cognitive enhancer and not to self-treat pain.\n",
      "The patient decided to take 2.5 gms (or grams) of green kratom (as ground leaf powder suspended in water). The product was purchased at a local shop in April 2020 sold under the name “Green Bali.” After 30 min, he noticed a significant improvement in the intensity of the physical symptoms (mainly pain and fatigue), and within 60 min he felt a sensation of mild euphoria and well-being that lasted for about 5 h. After 6 h following consumption the effects of kratom wore off, and the patient administered another dose. He used kratom three times a day continuously for 3 days (for a total of 9 doses of 2.75 g each) with significant benefit.\n",
      "When asked to score from 0 to 100% the improvement that kratom had on COVID-19 symptoms: fatigue and weakness (80% improvement), tiredness (70% improvement), body aches (80% improvement), muscle pain (90% improvement, “much better than paracetamol/acetaminophen”).

      "A 69-year-old Caucasian woman presented to outside hospital with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. Chest pain started approximately a week ago and lasted for about 5 days but then subsided for a day. Next day, the patient was experiencing continuous chest tightness both on right and left side. She was also having dyspnea on exertion. The patient had a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and severe degenerative joint disease. Past surgical history was significant for hysterectomy. She denied any history of smoking cigarettes or using illicit drugs. The patient had a history of occasional alcohol intake. Medications at home included amlodipine/benazepril 10/20 mg daily, raloxifene 60 mg daily, celecoxib 200 mg BID, clonazepam 1 mg daily, fenofibrate 145 mg daily, a multivitamin tablet daily, a calcium tablet 600 mg daily, glucosamine 1500 mg daily, tramadol/acetaminophen 37.5/325 mg BID, and hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10/300 mg as needed for pain.\n",
      "On arrival to the emergency department, the patient was tachycardic with a heart rate of 114/min, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24/min. She was normotensive at that time. Within the next few minutes, the patient became significantly hypotensive. Vitals at that time were blood pressure 78/52, heart rate 109/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and saturation of 96% on 3 L of oxygen via nasal cannula. On physical examination, the patient appeared to be in acute distress. On cardiovascular assessment, S1 and S2 were audible with no added murmur or gallop. She had bilateral pitting lower extremity edema. On lung examination, the patient had bilateral rhonchi and increased respiratory effort.\n",
      "EKG showed sinus tachycardia with q waves and ST segment elevations of almost 2 mm in leads III and aVF. There was also left atrial enlargement (). Radiograph of chest showed interstitial edema. Laboratory results from admission included a basal metabolic panel that showed blood urea nitrogen of 40 mg/dL (6–20 mg/dL), creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL (0.7–1.2 mg/dL), and potassium of 4.2 mEq/L (3.5–5.0 mEq/L). First set of troponin levels were found to be 1.60 ng/mL (0.0–0.3 ng/mL) and first set of CK was 118 U/L (29–200 U/L). A Doppler echocardiogram was done in the emergency room, which showed normal ejection fraction of 60–65% with RV hypokinesis, which was consistent with RVI.\n",
      "The patient was started on vasopressors and emergently transferred to our facility to undergo cardiac catheterization. Left heart catheterization revealed 99% stenosis to mid-right coronary artery and subsequently the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the right coronary artery. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed during cardiac catheterization as the patient was in cardiogenic shock. After successful PCI, the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed as her vitals seemed to have stabilized. Two days later, again the patient developed hypotension and worsening shortness of breath. Urgent bedside Doppler echocardiogram showed a new left-to-right shunt in the ventricle, which was noted to be a muscular VSD. The patient was transferred to a tertiary care medical center for surgical repair. At the tertiary care hospital, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was done, which revealed large VSD with a dimension of 1.38×0.9 cm2 and an area of 0.9 cm2 located in the posterior wall of ventricle (). TEE also showed mildly reduced RV systolic function and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation ( and ).\n",
      "The patient subsequently developed S. aureus bacteremia and Clostridium difficile colitis, which were successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics. She underwent cardiothoracic surgery for possible surgical versus percutaneous repair of the VSD.

After placement of the amplatzer VSD device, significant reduction in left-to-right shunt was noted on TEE. Also, hemodynamically the patient improved and her hypotension resolved, so the intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued.

      "A 27-year-old African American female patient with a history of stage IV endometriosis presented to the emergency department with exertional dyspnea of three-month duration. She also had an unintentional weight loss of approximately 25 pounds. The patient also endorsed night sweats, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and orthopnea, but she denied chest pain or lower extremity swelling. Of notice, the patient had an endometrial cyst removal performed five years ago and an endometriosis-related paracentesis performed three years ago. The last follow-up with obstetrics/gynecology was 13 months ago.\n",
      "On presentation, the patient had a blood pressure of 120/78 mmHg, a temperature of 36.6°C, a heart rate range of 75-90 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Chest auscultation revealed absent breath sounds on the right side of the chest.\n",
      "Laboratory studies were significant for a hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dl (12-16 g/dl). Other complete blood count parameters and electrolytes were within normal limits. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed complete opacification of the right chest with a left tracheal deviation (Figure ). Computed tomography of pulmonary arteries (CT-PA) was negative for pulmonary emboli, but it showed a massive right pleural effusion with complete atelectasis of the right lung in addition to a left-sided cardiomediastinal shift (Figure ). Thoracocentesis with the removal of 2 to 3 l of serosanguinous fluid was performed, fluids turned to be exudative with few glandular and endometrial cells on cytohistological examination. Because the patient’s condition was not improving, a chest tube was placed. Continuous chest tube drainage with serosanguinous fluid was noted for eight days. Because the patient’s condition did not significantly improve, a right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), a right diaphragm and pleural biopsy, and pleurodesis were performed, which revealed dense fibroconnective tissue with prominent chronic inflammation, including lymphoid aggregates and focal mesothelial hyperplasia (Figure ). No malignancy was reported in the histopathologic examination.\n",
      "Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis in addition to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was done; these investigations showed endometrioma of about 7.2 × 7.1 × 4.2 cm in the mid-upper pelvis with a moderate amount of hemorrhagic fluid in the pelvis and bilateral paracolic gutters (Figure ), and the latter finding was similar to a prior finding on a CT scan of the abdomen that was done three years ago. Because these fluids did not cause any symptoms to the patient, the obstetrics/gynecology team’s decision was not to drain, believing that the endometriosis treatment itself should improve this condition.\n",
      "Transvaginal ultrasonography and complete pelvic duplex ultrasonography of the lower abdomen showed a large septate cystic lesion in the left adnexa, which has been present for three years. The lesion was consistent with endometrioma (Figure ). The patient was discharged on Leuprolide Depot 11.25 mg injections every three months and norethindrone hormonal therapy of 5 mg tablets daily to prevent menopausal symptoms, with a close outpatient follow-up.\n",

      "A 73-year-old female was brought by emergency medical services (EMS) to the emergency department (ED) after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). She was driving when her car crashed into a streetlamp at 40 miles per hour. The EMS team reported that the pole intruded into the passenger compartment and the patient required a prolonged extrication. She had a Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) of 11 when EMS arrived at the scene, which improved to a 15 after repeated evaluations. She was conscious, alert, and oriented at the scene and during transport.\n",
      "The patient had difficulty recalling the events before the collision. She remembered feeling “like I was having a panic attack” just before the crash, and she did not recall the car impacting the streetlamp. In the ED, she complained of substernal chest pressure. The patient’s history was limited due to her continued difficulty recalling the events of the accident. The patient’s son was contacted and he stated that she lives alone and is active and independent. He stated that she had experienced syncopal episodes over the last several years, all associated with paroxysms of panic when driving, and she had undergone extensive workups without any clear etiology identified. She had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain with and without contrast four years prior for stroke-like symptoms after a syncopal event. Per his report, no abnormalities were found.\n",
      "The patient had a past medical history of anxiety, migraines, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and hyperlipidemia. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, which was treated with a left mastectomy followed by five years of tamoxifen and letrozole treatment. She had a family history of dementia, diabetes, and heart disease. She denied using tobacco, alcohol, or illicit substances. She was prescribed, and was taking, the following medications: levothyroxine 25 micrograms daily; atorvastatin 20 milligrams (mg) nightly; rizatriptan 10 mg as needed for headaches; and multivitamins.\n",
      "On physical exam, the patient’s temperature was 36.5° Celsius, her heart rate was 92 beats per minute, and her blood pressure was 142/72 millimeters of mercury. She was breathing at a rate of 21 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She weighed 125 pounds and was 5 feet, 3 inches tall, with a body mass index of 22.1 kilograms per meter squared. She did not appear to be in any acute distress, was healthy appearing, and was oriented to her name, date, and location. Her head was normocephalic and atraumatic; she had no Battle sign, raccoon eyes, or other signs of trauma. She had hearing aids in place bilaterally. She had normal extraocular movements with equal pupils that were reactive to light. She had a cervical collar in place. Later, when it was safe to remove her collar, her neck had a normal range of motion without rigidity or pain.\n",
      "On auscultation, her heart had a regular S1 and S2 at a normal rate and was without murmurs. She had normal pulses bilaterally. Her lungs were clear without wheezing or rhonchi, and she was noted to have normal effort without respiratory distress. Her abdomen was soft and flat, without tenderness or guarding. Her musculoskeletal exam showed an overall normal range of motion without deformities. She had no step-offs of the spinous processes or tenderness along the midline spine. The remainder of her skeletal exam only revealed tenderness over the left wrist. She had a capillary refill of less than two seconds.

      "A 66-year-old man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia was brought to the ED for altered mental status. The patient’s wife reported that two hours prior to arrival, he had ingested two glasses of wine and took a nap. Prior to napping the wife noted no unusual symptoms. Upon awaking, he was noted to have dysarthria and discoordination of his extremities and was brought to the ED. His wife reported that his home medications included bupropion, dutasteride, lisinopril, and tolterodine.\n",
      "His vital signs were blood pressure 115/78 millimeters mercury, heart rate 83 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, temperature 36.8° Celsius, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. On exam, the patient was noted to have waxing and waning alertness, but he could intermittently answer questions and follow commands. His pupils were reactive, sluggish, and with horizontal and vertical nystagmus. His face was symmetric and his tongue was midline. His speech was dysarthric. He was unable to follow commands for strength testing, but he was moving all extremities without appreciable asymmetry. He had bilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing. He had truncal ataxia in the seated position. His mental status and ataxia progressively worsened during his ED stay of approximately 1.5 hours.\n",
      "Given the acute onset of symptoms, an institutional stroke alert was activated and a head computed tomography angiogram was obtained, which was negative for hemorrhage or other abnormality. Laboratory values, including complete blood count, chemistry panel, coagulation panel, and urinalysis were within normal limits. His blood alcohol level was 57 mg/dL. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with a QRS of 108 ms and a QTc of 497 ms. A dose of naloxone 0.4 milligrams was trialed without improvement in patient’s somnolence. He was evaluated by the neurology consultant team and determined to have a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale of 11. Given concern for a posterior circulation stroke, tissue plasminogen activator was administered for thrombolysis. The patient was subsequently intubated for airway protection due to increasing somnolence and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).\n",
      "While intubated in the ICU, the patient developed status epilepticus, characterized by three periods of generalized tonic clonic activity, each lasting approximately five minutes. He received multiple doses of benzodiazepine and phenytoin, in addition to the propofol infusion for sedation, resulting in cessation of seizure activity. Subsequent electroencephalogram did not demonstrate ongoing seizure activity, and the patient did not have an additional seizure during the hospital course while maintained on phenytoin.\n",
      "Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain did not show evidence of acute stroke. Comprehensive urine drug screen by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry was positive for clozapine and clozapine metabolites, in addition to caffeine and bupropion, a home medication. No drugs of abuse or other medications were detected. However, the patient had never been prescribed clozapine. In discussion with his wife, it was learned that the patient’s family member takes clozapine for a psychiatric condition. The patient manages the family member’s medication and they frequently take their respective medications at the same time. It was concluded that the patient must have mistaken the family member’s medication for his and accidently ingested the family member’s usual dose of 200 mg of clozapine, hours prior to his presentation. The patient was extubated on hospital day three and discharged with a normal neurologic exam and no further seizure activity on hospital day five.\n",

      "A 66-year-old man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia was brought to the ED for altered mental status. The patient’s wife reported that two hours prior to arrival, he had ingested two glasses of wine and took a nap. Prior to napping the wife noted no unusual symptoms. Upon awaking, he was noted to have dysarthria and discoordination of his extremities and was brought to the ED. His wife reported that his home medications included bupropion, dutasteride, lisinopril, and tolterodine.\n",
      "His vital signs were blood pressure 115/78 millimeters mercury, heart rate 83 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, temperature 36.8° Celsius, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. On exam, the patient was noted to have waxing and waning alertness, but he could intermittently answer questions and follow commands. His pupils were reactive, sluggish, and with horizontal and vertical nystagmus. His face was symmetric and his tongue was midline. His speech was dysarthric. He was unable to follow commands for strength testing, but he was moving all extremities without appreciable asymmetry. He had bilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing. He had truncal ataxia in the seated position. His mental status and ataxia progressively worsened during his ED stay of approximately 1.5 hours.\n",
      "Given the acute onset of symptoms, an institutional stroke alert was activated and a head computed tomography angiogram was obtained, which was negative for hemorrhage or other abnormality. Laboratory values, including complete blood count, chemistry panel, coagulation panel, and urinalysis were within normal limits. His blood alcohol level was 57 mg/dL. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with a QRS of 108 ms and a QTc of 497 ms. A dose of naloxone 0.4 milligrams was trialed without improvement in patient’s somnolence. He was evaluated by the neurology consultant team and determined to have a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale of 11. Given concern for a posterior circulation stroke, tissue plasminogen activator was administered for thrombolysis. The patient was subsequently intubated for airway protection due to increasing somnolence and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).\n",
      "While intubated in the ICU, the patient developed status epilepticus, characterized by three periods of generalized tonic clonic activity, each lasting approximately five minutes. He received multiple doses of benzodiazepine and phenytoin, in addition to the propofol infusion for sedation, resulting in cessation of seizure activity. Subsequent electroencephalogram did not demonstrate ongoing seizure activity, and the patient did not have an additional seizure during the hospital course while maintained on phenytoin.\n",
      "Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain did not show evidence of acute stroke. Comprehensive urine drug screen by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry was positive for clozapine and clozapine metabolites, in addition to caffeine and bupropion, a home medication. No drugs of abuse or other medications were detected. However, the patient had never been prescribed clozapine. In discussion with his wife, it was learned that the patient’s family member takes clozapine for a psychiatric condition.

He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nasopharyngeal swab. His vital signs on examination were notable for a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and a temperature of 38.2°C. His chest X-ray was unremarkable. Given his clinical stability, further labwork was deferred and the patient was discharged from the ED to self-quarantine at home. Over the subsequent 3 weeks, the patient’s symptoms completely resolved. He had repeat COVID-19 testing prior to returning to work, which was negative.\n",
      "Two months after his negative COVID-19 testing, the patient developed progressive dyspnoea with minimal exertion. He had an episode of syncope which prompted him to return to the ED for further evaluation. On presentation, his blood pressure was 126/99 mmHg, heart rate 122 beats per minute, temperature 37.5°C, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Physical examination was notable for tachycardia with regular rhythm, 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border, positive jugular venous distention to 10 cm, lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, and no evidence of lower extremity oedema.\n",

Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with an S1Q3T3 pattern (see ). Given the significantly elevated D-dimer and history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a computed tomography angiogram with PE protocol was obtained that demonstrated acute bilateral PE described as a central obstructive clot with acute thrombus and a high obstructive score as defined by a modified Miller score of 15 (see ). Bedside echocardiography revealed severe right ventricular (RV) enlargement (6.5 cm) (), positive McConnell’s sign, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (), right ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral (RVOT VTI) of 6.69 cm (normal > 10 cm) (), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion of 10 mm (normal > 18 mm) (), and an right ventricular:left ventricular ratio of 2.4 (normal < 1) ().

      "An 84-year-old woman presented to our hospital with complaints of a 1-week history of abdominal pain and appetite loss. The patient had no history of cough, sputum, fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. She had no history of tobacco smoking, tuberculosis or exposure to individuals with tuberculosis. She did not have a history of malignancy, diabetes mellitus, cytotoxic therapy or corticosteroid use. Her family history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 90 beats/min, blood pressure of 157/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, temperature of 37.8 °C and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Respiratory, cardiac and abdominal examination were unremarkable. Chest radiograph showed multiple small nodules in both lung fields and chest computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse micronodules in random patterns in both lung lobes, cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusion (Figs. and ). White blood cell count, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were 2800 /μl, 7.50 mg/dl (normal range 0.00–0.10 mg/dl) and 0.373 ng/ml (normal range 0.000–0.046 ng/ml), respectively. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19–9 and soluble IL-2 receptor were elevated at 9.4 ng/ml (normal range 0.0–5.0 ng/ml), 188.4 U/ml (normal range 0.0–37.0 U/ml) and 6163 U/ml (normal range 0–500 U/ml), respectively. Angiotensin-converting enzyme, mycoplasma antibody and blood sugar were within normal ranges. Serum QuantiFERON testing was positive. CD4/8 ratio, CD4 count and CD8 count were 1.73 (normal range 0.6–2.9), 422 /μl (normal range 344–1289) and 244 /μl (normal range 110–1066), respectively. IgG, IgA and IgM were 998 mg/dl (normal range 870–1700), 128 mg/dl (normal range 110–410), 59 mg/dl (normal range 46–260), respectively. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection was negative. Expectorated sputum smears were negative for bacteria and acid-fast bacilli. Urinary antigen testing (Binax NOW; Binax, Inc., Portland, ME) for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila was negative. According to these results, we initially suspected intraabdominal malignancy including malignant lymphoma. However, abdominal CT and magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormalities. Therefore, we suspected miliary tuberculosis or pulmonary sarcoidosis. Liver, skin and bone marrow biopsies were subsequently performed and showed epithelioid cell granuloma without caseous necrosis. Gastric aspirate smear was positive for acid-fast bacilli and polymerase chain reaction (Loopamp; Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although these microbiological findings might indicate the presence of non-viable M. tuberculosis, miliary tuberculosis was suspected and antimycobacterial therapy [oral isoniazid (INH) 200 mg/day, rifampicin (RFP) 300 mg/day and ethambutol (EB) 500 mg/day] was initiated on hospital day 12. Gastric aspirate culture was positive for M. tuberculosis after 1 week of culture. After a 2-month treatment course, chest radiograph showed gradual improvement, oral EB was discontinued and the patient was discharged. Although INH and RFP therapy was continued, chest radiograph showed new multiple nodules in the right middle lung field after a 6-month treatment course. Chest CT showed that a right S6 small nodule, presumed to be miliary tuberculosis, had increased and new multiple nodules appeared in the right lower lobe (Fig. ). The patient’s white blood cell count and C-reactive protein at this time were 2400 /μl and 0.09 mg/dl, respectively. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy was subsequently perfomed. Microbiological testing of bronchial lavage fluids did not reveal any bacteria, mycobacteria or fungi. However, cytology showed a small number of Periodic acid-Schiff-positive bodies, suggesting Cryptococcus species (Fig. ). Moreover, serum cryptococcal antigen testing (Serodirect “EIKEN” Cryptococcus; Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) was positive (×128). According to these findings, pulmonary cryptococcosis was diagnosed, although the culture was negative. Oral fluconazole (FLCZ; 300 mg/day) was subsequently initiated. After a 6-month treatment course, chest radiograph showed gradual improvement and oral FLCZ was discontinued. The patient received a total of 12 months of antimycobacterial therapy. On follow-up, she has remained asymptomatic with suspect to pulmonary disease, with no recurrence.\n",

Respiratory, cardiac and abdominal examination were unremarkable. Chest radiograph showed multiple small nodules in both lung fields and chest computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse micronodules in random patterns in both lung lobes, cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusion (Figs. and ). White blood cell count, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were 2800 /μl, 7.50 mg/dl (normal range 0.00–0.10 mg/dl) and 0.373 ng/ml (normal range 0.000–0.046 ng/ml), respectively. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19–9 and soluble IL-2 receptor were elevated at 9.4 ng/ml (normal range 0.0–5.0 ng/ml), 188.4 U/ml (normal range 0.0–37.0 U/ml) and 6163 U/ml (normal range 0–500 U/ml), respectively. Angiotensin-converting enzyme, mycoplasma antibody and blood sugar were within normal ranges. Serum QuantiFERON testing was positive. CD4/8 ratio, CD4 count and CD8 count were 1.73 (normal range 0.6–2.9), 422 /μl (normal range 344–1289) and 244 /μl (normal range 110–1066), respectively. IgG, IgA and IgM were 998 mg/dl (normal range 870–1700), 128 mg/dl (normal range 110–410), 59 mg/dl (normal range 46–260), respectively. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection was negative. Expectorated sputum smears were negative for bacteria and acid-fast bacilli. Urinary antigen testing (Binax NOW; Binax, Inc., Portland, ME) for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila was negative. According to these results, we initially suspected intraabdominal malignancy including malignant lymphoma. However, abdominal CT and magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormalities. Therefore, we suspected miliary tuberculosis or pulmonary sarcoidosis. Liver, skin and bone marrow biopsies were subsequently performed and showed epithelioid cell granuloma without caseous necrosis. Gastric aspirate smear was positive for acid-fast bacilli and polymerase chain reaction (Loopamp; Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although these microbiological findings might indicate the presence of non-viable M. tuberculosis, miliary tuberculosis was suspected and antimycobacterial therapy [oral isoniazid (INH) 200 mg/day, rifampicin (RFP) 300 mg/day and ethambutol (EB) 500 mg/day] was initiated on hospital day 12. Gastric aspirate culture was positive for M. tuberculosis after 1 week of culture. After a 2-month treatment course, chest radiograph showed gradual improvement, oral EB was discontinued and the patient was discharged. Although INH and RFP therapy was continued, chest radiograph showed new multiple nodules in the right middle lung field after a 6-month treatment course. Chest CT showed that a right S6 small nodule, presumed to be miliary tuberculosis, had increased and new multiple nodules appeared in the right lower lobe (Fig. ). The patient’s white blood cell count and C-reactive protein at this time were 2400 /μl and 0.09 mg/dl, respectively. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy was subsequently perfomed. Microbiological testing of bronchial lavage fluids did not reveal any bacteria, mycobacteria or fungi. However, cytology showed a small number of Periodic acid-Schiff-positive bodies, suggesting Cryptococcus species (Fig. ). Moreover, serum cryptococcal antigen testing (Serodirect “EIKEN” Cryptococcus; Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) was positive (×128). According to these findings, pulmonary cryptococcosis was diagnosed, although the culture was negative. Oral fluconazole (FLCZ; 300 mg/day) was subsequently initiated. After a 6-month treatment course, chest radiograph showed gradual improvement and oral FLCZ was discontinued. The patient received a total of 12 months of antimycobacterial therapy. On follow-up, she has remained asymptomatic with suspect to pulmonary disease, with no recurrence.\n",

      "A 66-year-old Caucasian man with no significant past medical history presented with flu-like symptoms, progressively worsening shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing (NYHA class III) and dry cough over the past 2 weeks prior to presentation. He denied any fever, chills, sputum production, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, anorexia, weight loss, recent or past exposure to tuberculosis, sick contacts, pets, recent travel or past exposure to cigarette smoke (active or passive), asbestos, silica, coal dust or chemicals. He maintained an active lifestyle walking 5 miles three times a week without overt dyspnea. He had no prior history of connective tissue disease or HIV and denied any history of skin rash or joint pains. Past surgical, social and family histories were non-contributory. He also had no history of prior use of any long term medications. He had presented to the hospital 4 days prior to present admission and a provisional diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia was made based on chest radiograph findings and he was discharged home on 2L of oxygen and Levofloxacin, but came back to the hospital due to lack of obvious improvement.\n",
      "On examination, he appeared tired with shortness of breath. The temperature was 99.9°F, the pulse 124/min, respiratory rate 26/min and oxygen saturation of 86% on 2L. Skin was diaphoretic. There was no evidence of rash, pallor, lymphadenopathy, clubbing, joint swelling or edema. Auscultation of chest revealed diminished breath sounds with bilateral velcro-like fine inspiratory crackles. Laboratory studies showed a normal complete blood count, metabolic panel, liver function tests, cardiac enzymes, BNP, lactate, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen and TSH. D-dimer was elevated at 15.4 (normal <1.6). ESR was 52 mm/hour. Rheumatoid factor was <5 (negative). ANA, p-ANCA and c-ANCA were negative. Blood cultures (bacterial/fungal/mycobacterial), urine legionella and streptococcal antigen were negative. Viral respiratory panel, including cytomegalovirus & Herpes Simplex Virus PCR were also negative. ABG showed hypoxemia with respiratory alkalosis. Pulmonary function tests showed restrictive pattern of lung disease. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal cardiac chamber sizes and left ventricular ejection fraction of 81%.\n",
      "Plain chest radiograph (Fig. ) showed bilateral basilar infiltrates and a peripheral reticulonodular pattern superimposed on generalized interstitial changes, involving the upper lobes as well as lung bases. High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) of the chest (Fig. and ) revealed moderate to severe thickening of intralobular septa, septal line formation, parenchymal band formation and peribronchial thickening, ground glass opacities and mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy (likely reactive, largest lymph node being 1.1 cm) was noted. This was consistent with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) without a specific pattern. At this time, treatment with levofloxacin was continued and solumedrol was added for empirical therapy. Computed Tomogram (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis was normal with no evidence of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Despite steroid therapy, the patient's respiratory status deteriorated over the next day requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Consequently, consent for wedge biopsy of the lung was obtained for a pathological diagnosis to guide further therapy.\n",
      "A right lung wedge biopsy was obtained by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). A polymorphic lymphoid infiltrate composed of large atypical cells, small lymphocytes and many plasma cells was noted, with lymphoid cells infiltrating blood vessels and bronchial walls (Fig. ). Multinucleated large Reed Sternberg-like cells were also present along with foci of necrosis. Bronchial washings showed atypical benign bronchial cells and pulmonary macrophages with a few rare atypical Reed-Sternberg-like cells. Bone marrow biopsy was normal.\n",

Many CD138+ plasma cells exhibiting polyclonal staining pattern for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains were also seen. Bone marrow biopsy revealed normal cellularity with no evidence of lymphoma. In situ hybridization for EBV encoded RNA (EBER) was positive within scattered large lymphoid cells throughout the biopsy specimen (Fig. ).\n",
      "Based on the pathological and immuno-histochemical findings, a diagnosis of Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis was made. Treatment with high dose steroids and rituximab showed significant clinical improvement and he was extubated 4 days after starting therapy. Treatment was continued with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisolone chemotherapy and he showed gradual but slow resolution of clinical and x-ray findings. However, he subsequently developed pancytopenia consequent to chemotherapy, septic shock requiring increasing doses of pressors and acute renal failure which did not respond to aggressive management and he was terminally weaned per family wishes 4 weeks later.

Many CD138+ plasma cells exhibiting polyclonal staining pattern for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains were also seen. Bone marrow biopsy revealed normal cellularity with no evidence of lymphoma. In situ hybridization for EBV encoded RNA (EBER) was positive within scattered large lymphoid cells throughout the biopsy specimen (Fig. ).\n",
      "Based on the pathological and immuno-histochemical findings, a diagnosis of Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis was made. Treatment with high dose steroids and rituximab showed significant clinical improvement and he was extubated 4 days after starting therapy. Treatment was continued with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisolone chemotherapy and he showed gradual but slow resolution of clinical and x-ray findings. However, he subsequently developed pancytopenia consequent to chemotherapy, septic shock requiring increasing doses of pressors and acute renal failure which did not respond to aggressive management and he was terminally weaned per family wishes 4 weeks later. A chest-only autopsy revealed diffuse alveolar damage, likely secondary to sepsis or chemotherapy or both, but no evidence of residual LG was noted within the lungs (Fig. ).\n",

      "A 17-year-old female presented with 1-month history of more noticeable weight loss and increased tiredness. Over the last 6 years since immigrating to the United States with her family from Burma and going through puberty, her body habitus has changed to a very thin appearance. This period of time began with menarche, which subsequently demonstrated intermittent oligomenorrhea occasionally alternating with amenorrhea. Apparently, workup by a gynecologist was negative and a yearlong period of oral contraceptive use did little to change the scant flow pattern. She discontinued these 6 months ago. The patient’s diet history revealed 3 meals a day of normal type foods but always smaller portions than other members of her family. Mother agreed that she does not eat much fried or fast foods, usually what is prepared for the family at home. The patient eventually suggested after repetitive questions that there was an increase in early satiety over the last month and she clearly was overall more tired. Five months ago, she had an outpatient visit for viral syndrome with vomiting and diarrhea, which resolved in 48 hours. At that time, her weight was 42 kg and no fever noted. Review of systems was notable for fatigue, intermittent chills, hair loss with nonvigorous brushing, intermittent “shakiness” when getting up, and shortness of breath on exertion. She denied any fever, upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, coughing, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, abdominal pain other than associated with her menstrual cycle, rashes, easy bruising or bleeding. Her past medical history was notable for the oligomenorrhea and scoliosis, but prior testing for anemia reported negative 6 months ago, and all chronic diseases, including in other members of the family, was denied, including anemia, thalassemia, and tuberculosis. The patient reports feeling “sad sometimes” but denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. In the emergency department, her physical exam (PE) was notable for a tired appearing but otherwise well teenage girl with a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate 125, respiratory rate 16, pulse oxygenation saturation of 97% on room air, weight 40 kg, height 144.78 cm, body mass index 20.1, some hair loss with brushing, II/VI systolic murmur over LUSB, and mild nonpitting bilateral edema. The remainder of the PE was unremarkable. Laboratory values were remarkable for white blood cell count 4700/µL with neutrophilic predominance, hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL, hematocrit 24.8%, mean corpuscular volume 74.9 fL, red cell distribution width 18.4%. Chemistry panel was within normal limits except for low albumin 2.9 g/dL, and a slightly elevated aspartate transaminase 54 U/L. Thyroid studies demonstrated slightly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone of 6.68 mIU/L (05-6.0) with normal free T4 of 1.08 ng/dL (0.7-1.9). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated to 65.4 mg/L (normal 0-5) and 132 mm/h (normal 0-20), respectively. Urinalysis was unremarkable and urine pregnancy test was negative. Additional iron studies demonstrated levels of iron 29 µg/dL, ferritin 3 ng/mL, and a total iron binding capacity of 144 µg/dL. Given the severe anemia and elevated inflammatory markers, the decision was made to admit the patient for further workup.\n",

Over the last 6 years since immigrating to the United States with her family from Burma and going through puberty, her body habitus has changed to a very thin appearance. This period of time began with menarche, which subsequently demonstrated intermittent oligomenorrhea occasionally alternating with amenorrhea. Apparently, workup by a gynecologist was negative and a yearlong period of oral contraceptive use did little to change the scant flow pattern. She discontinued these 6 months ago. The patient’s diet history revealed 3 meals a day of normal type foods but always smaller portions than other members of her family. Mother agreed that she does not eat much fried or fast foods, usually what is prepared for the family at home. The patient eventually suggested after repetitive questions that there was an increase in early satiety over the last month and she clearly was overall more tired. Five months ago, she had an outpatient visit for viral syndrome with vomiting and diarrhea, which resolved in 48 hours. At that time, her weight was 42 kg and no fever noted. Review of systems was notable for fatigue, intermittent chills, hair loss with nonvigorous brushing, intermittent “shakiness” when getting up, and shortness of breath on exertion. She denied any fever, upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, coughing, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, abdominal pain other than associated with her menstrual cycle, rashes, easy bruising or bleeding. Her past medical history was notable for the oligomenorrhea and scoliosis, but prior testing for anemia reported negative 6 months ago, and all chronic diseases, including in other members of the family, was denied, including anemia, thalassemia, and tuberculosis. The patient reports feeling “sad sometimes” but denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. In the emergency department, her physical exam (PE) was notable for a tired appearing but otherwise well teenage girl with a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate 125, respiratory rate 16, pulse oxygenation saturation of 97% on room air, weight 40 kg, height 144.78 cm, body mass index 20.1, some hair loss with brushing, II/VI systolic murmur over LUSB, and mild nonpitting bilateral edema. The remainder of the PE was unremarkable. Laboratory values were remarkable for white blood cell count 4700/µL with neutrophilic predominance, hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL, hematocrit 24.8%, mean corpuscular volume 74.9 fL, red cell distribution width 18.4%. Chemistry panel was within normal limits except for low albumin 2.9 g/dL, and a slightly elevated aspartate transaminase 54 U/L. Thyroid studies demonstrated slightly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone of 6.68 mIU/L (05-6.0) with normal free T4 of 1.08 ng/dL (0.7-1.9). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated to 65.4 mg/L (normal 0-5) and 132 mm/h (normal 0-20), respectively. Urinalysis was unremarkable and urine pregnancy test was negative. Additional iron studies demonstrated levels of iron 29 µg/dL, ferritin 3 ng/mL, and a total iron binding capacity of 144 µg/dL. Given the severe anemia and elevated inflammatory markers, the decision was made to admit the patient for further workup.\n",

      "A 56-year-old man presented to a peripheral hospital with a history of severe acute central chest pain accompanied by sweating. He has been suffering from diabetes mellitus for 3 years for which he was taking oral hypoglycemic agent (glibenclamide 5 mg, BID). However, he was not on regular follow-up. He was hypertensive for 3 years and for which he was on regular medication.\n",
      "He was diagnosed with acute ST-segment elevation extensive anterior wall myocardial infarction and was given Streptokinase due to unavailability of reteplase/alteplase. Although the chest pain improved, his post lysis ECG showed poor resolution. However, next morning the ECG showed transient inferior leads ST elevation with fast atrial fibrillation (AF). He was given a bolus intravenous amiodarone (300 mg). While he was on amiodarone infusion, he became hypotensive and dobutamine was started at low dose (5 mcg/kg/min). Eventually, his case was discussed and it was decided he needed a tertiary care hospital. He was shifted with 12 hours for further management.\n",
      "On arrival, his radial arterial blood pressure was 106/70 mmHg, mean arterial BP was 59 mmHg. He was maintained on low dose dobutamine. The PR was 96 b.p.m, in sinus rhythm. His urine output was 75 ml / hour. On physical examination, he had bilateral fine crepitation and a pan systolic murmur at the left lower sternal area, radiating to the right precordium. Further examination showed the jugular venous pulse was mildly raised but no lower leg edema and warm touch. Oxygen saturation was 98% on 4 L/min oxygen facemask.\n",
      "Electrocardiography [] revealed sinus rhythm with persistent ST-segment elevation in the anterior (V1-V6) with established Q-waves in anterior leads. Chest X-ray [] showed bilateral mild pulmonary congestion.\n",
      "Transthoracic echocardiography revealed multiple (2–3 mm) apical muscular ventricular septal defects (VSD) with the largest VSD measuring 1 cm [], and a left to right shunt []. Left ventricular (LV) systolic function was mildly impaired with an ejection fraction of 45%. The left ventricular apex was akinetic. There was Grade-I diastolic dysfunction with normal right side dimension and functions. There was no significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis, but there was moderate pericardial effusion measuring 1.6 cm posteriorly and 1.1 cm anteriorly []. There was no sign of cardiac tamponade. The results of the biochemical Labs were unremarkable except for mild renal impairment (creatinine 105 mmol/L, eGFR-65) and raised Troponin T (364 pg/ml). Lactate level was 2.1mmol/L.\n",
      "Coronary angiography (CAG) revealed the left anterior descending artery had tight lesions in the proximal (95%) and mid segment (85%) with diffusely diseased distal LAD []. Right coronary had proximal 30% stenosis; the right posterior descending artery had ostial (90%) lesion []. There was non-significant lesion at distal left circumflex artery. LV Angiography showed Apical VSR with LV to RV flow [Figure and ].\n",
      "His Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention (SCAI) cardiogenic shock (CS) stage was determined to be Stage B. At this time cardiac surgeons were consulted, who advised to continue medical treatment with an intention to heal infarct area spontaneously and they would consider either for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) plus VSD repair versus Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) plus device closure.\n",
      "The patient was initially treated medically with intravenous diuretics, inotropes, and with oral aspirin and statin. Gradually, all inotropes were tapered off and he was clinically asymptomatic with stable hemodynamics without support of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). Later, low dose of lisinopril and carvedilol was added as vasodilators to reduce afterload.\n",
      "Eventually, at the eighteenth day of admission, the patient underwent CABG (one venous graft to r-PDA) with simultaneous repair of VSD with Gortex patch with infarct exclusion technique. The LAD artery could not be grafted due to poor visualization hence dit was decided for PCI later if needed.\n",
      "Postoperatively, the patient remained stable and was extubated the next day. Follow-up echocardiography revealed no residual intra-cardiac shunt. He was discharged on the 7th post-operative day in stable condition. Due to expatriate issue, a follow-up was arranged over telephone at 2 weeks. After two months, he was asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable and could perform routine daily activities. Later a clinic follow- up was arranged with echocardiography.\n",

      "A 70-year-old man presented with dyspnoea and palpitations on exertion to the emergency department (ED). His medical history was significant for stage IV clear cell RCC, chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation with warfarin, coronary artery disease status post the placement of two stents with an ischaemic cardiomyopathy and a LVEF of 40%–45%. He was recently started on pazopanib for systemic treatment of metastatic RCC. Pazopanib was started at 75% of the recommended dose. At the initiation of therapy, the patient had a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL and was able to walk 90 min a day without any complaints.\n",
      "Within the first week of starting pazopanib, the patient developed dyspnoea on exertion that progressed rapidly to dyspnoea on minimal exertion. He was no longer able to conduct his daily walks. On the 10th day after starting pazopanib, he was unable to shave himself due to dyspnoea, which prompted his ED presentation. In the ED, his blood pressure (BP) was 122/70 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) was 93 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate (RR) was 22 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. On physical examination, auscultation of the heart was significant for an irregular rhythm with no additional heart sounds or signs of volume overload. His lungs were clear to auscultation, and the remainder of the examination was unremarkable.\n",
      "Initial labs were significant for a creatinine of 1.4 mg/mL and a supratherapeutic international normalised ratio of 4.0. Blood counts, electrolytes and liver function tests were within normal limits. His B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 2685 pg/mL. His troponin results were negative. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation without significant changes compared with previous tracings. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest in the ED showed heterogeneous opacification of the left main pulmonary artery with concern for a non-occlusive thrombus.\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the hospital and empirically started on anticoagulation with enoxaparin for presumed pulmonary embolism (PE). On the second day, he presented with worsening shortness of breath and compromised mental status. On physical examination, he was dyspnoeic and tachypnoeic with RR of 40 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of 95% on 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. His HR ranged between 140 and 150 bpm and his BP was 96/53 mm Hg. He was in respiratory distress, unable to speak in full sentences but alert and following commands.\n",

At the initiation of therapy, the patient had a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL and was able to walk 90 min a day without any complaints.\n",
      "Within the first week of starting pazopanib, the patient developed dyspnoea on exertion that progressed rapidly to dyspnoea on minimal exertion. He was no longer able to conduct his daily walks. On the 10th day after starting pazopanib, he was unable to shave himself due to dyspnoea, which prompted his ED presentation. In the ED, his blood pressure (BP) was 122/70 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) was 93 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate (RR) was 22 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. On physical examination, auscultation of the heart was significant for an irregular rhythm with no additional heart sounds or signs of volume overload. His lungs were clear to auscultation, and the remainder of the examination was unremarkable.\n",
      "Initial labs were significant for a creatinine of 1.4 mg/mL and a supratherapeutic international normalised ratio of 4.0. Blood counts, electrolytes and liver function tests were within normal limits. His B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 2685 pg/mL. His troponin results were negative. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation without significant changes compared with previous tracings. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest in the ED showed heterogeneous opacification of the left main pulmonary artery with concern for a non-occlusive thrombus.\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the hospital and empirically started on anticoagulation with enoxaparin for presumed pulmonary embolism (PE). On the second day, he presented with worsening shortness of breath and compromised mental status. On physical examination, he was dyspnoeic and tachypnoeic with RR of 40 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of 95% on 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. His HR ranged between 140 and 150 bpm and his BP was 96/53 mm Hg. He was in respiratory distress, unable to speak in full sentences but alert and following commands.\n",

      "A 69-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital after returning from a one-month vacation to Myanmar that included horseback riding. The patient had not taken malaria prophylaxis and did not receive any vaccinations prior to his departure. The patient's medical history was remarkable for gout, ciguatera, and neurosurgical reconstruction of the skull after a basilar skull fracture. The latter occurred 5 years before this event (after a fall from a horse), and it was complicated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and right-sided glossopharyngeal and vagal nerve damage, which resulted in right-sided vocal cord paralysis with hoarseness and sporadic aspiration. The patient did not take any medications and did not smoke, but he drank wine regularly.\n",
      "For the last few days, the patient had been increasingly tired and somnolent, with complaints of headache, left-sided ear pain, and night sweats. One day prior to admission, the patient had become increasingly confused. On the day of his admission, he was found by his wife lying on the floor of his home, confused, agitated, shivering, and incontinent of urine. At the emergency department, the patient's temperature was 39.2 °C, and his heart rate was 111 beats per minute, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and a blood pressure of 161/88 mmHg. The patient's peripheral oxygen saturation was 87%, and his Glasgow Coma Scale was scored as 9 (E2 M5 V2). Clinical examination revealed fasciculations of the face and lower legs and crepitation over the right lower lung on pulmonary auscultation. There was no purpura or nuchal rigidity.\n",
      "At that time, blood results revealed a leukocyte count of 34 900 × 109/l (normal: 4 300–10 000) (>95% being neutrophils) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 204 mg/l (normal value <3). A chest X-ray revealed no abnormalities. A CT scan of the brain showed only nonspecific white matter lesions but no haemorrhage or oedema. Lumbar puncture examination revealed a leukocyte count of 1160/mm3 (almost all neutrophils), a normal glucose level, and a total protein level of 128 mg/dl (normal value 15–40) accompanied by an elevated lactate level of 6.1 meq/l. Gram stain showed irregularly shaped cocci. Bacterial meningitis was suspected, and after obtaining two sets of blood cultures, empirical therapy with 2 g of intravenous ceftriaxone every 12 h, 2 g of ampicillin every 4 h and 10 mg/kg of acyclovir every 8 h was initiated. Shortly after starting the antibiotic therapy, the patient became more somnolent and developed a left-sided hemiplegia, left-sided central facial palsy, and right-sided head and eye deviation, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Because of increasingly obstructive respirations and an increasing oxygen need by the next day, the patient was intubated and ventilated.\n",
      "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures showed β-hemolytic colonies; blood and CSF cultures were positive for Streptococcus equi. Intravenous treatment with 2 g of ceftriaxone every 12 h was continued for 21 days, while ampicillin and acyclovir were discontinued. In vitro testing confirmed a sensitivity to ceftriaxone. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (FLAIR) showed a “dirty CSF” appearance in the right parietal region (, white arrow). Axial () and sagittal () T1-weighted images after the intravenous administration of gadolinium-chelate revealed a focal area of superficial contrast enhancement overlying the cerebral cortex, presumably representing a thickened pia mater and opacification of the left mastoid. In view of the MRI lesions and the left hemiplegia, one gram of intravenous methylprednisolone once daily was added to the treatment for 3 days with gradual tapering afterwards because meningoencephalitis with accompanying cerebral vasculitis was suspected []. After 4 days, the patient was weaned from the ventilator and extubated. Initially, the patient remained very agitated and disoriented and was temporarily treated with 25 mg of twice daily quetiapine and 100 mg of daily trazodone. Nine days after admission to the ICU, the patient was transferred to the neurology department. Later, this Streptococcus equi was identified as S. equi subspecies equi (at the National Reference Center for Invasive Non-Group B Beta-Hemolytic Streptococci, Belgium).\n",
      "The patient initially recovered completely and had no complaints apart from mild gait disturbances and light-headedness at a follow-up appointment 3 months after discharge. Because of the patient's prior medical history of basilar skull fracture and opacification of the left mastoid on brain MRI, despite a lack of clinical evidence of acute otitis or mastoiditis, an additional CT scan of the base of the skull was performed to rule out possible portals of entry for central nervous system (CNS) infection. The CT scan revealed only an asymmetrical widening of the left squamosal suture; therefore, we opted for a conservative approach.\n",
      "One month later (5 months after the initial referral), the patient was readmitted with intracranial bleeding, and consecutive CT scans showed multiple right-sided cerebral haemorrhages, with the largest located precentrally in the frontal lobe with small perilesional parietal and temporal haemorrhages accompanied by a left hemiparesis and aphasia (). CT angiography examination (, para-axial MPR) showed multiple tortuous, engorged pial veins of the right hemisphere. Cerebral angiography confirmed the presence of a suspected superficial dural arteriovenous fistula (, lateral projection of right internal carotid artery injection, large black arrow) in the right parietal region. The arterial feeders were mainly meningeal branches originating from the right ophthalmic artery and transosseous feeders from the right superficial temporal and occipital arteries (, lateral projection right external carotid artery injection); in addition, there was limited arterial supply to the fistula from the left middle meningeal artery across the midline (not shown). Venous drainage was through a large, right temporal draining vein (large white arrow) with reflux into multiple tortuous, superficial frontotemporal veins, as shown in , indicating a fistula with high risk of haemorrhage.\n",
      "Comparison of the axial T2-weighted images of MRI examinations at initial admittance () and at the second admission () showed the new finding of dilated pial veins (encircled), demonstrating de novo development of the dural AV fistula.\n",
      "The dural AV fistula was excised by the neurosurgeon. Microscopy of the resected dura showed a previously damaged vein with inflammatory remnants and granulation tissue in its wall (Figures and ). The patient was discharged to home with a hemiparesis that was still present. Seven months later, after this second event, the patient's GCS was 15/15, and the hemiparesis had almost completely disappeared.\n",

The patient was the restrained driver in a collision while traveling at approximately 45 miles per hour when a car turned in front of him at an intersection. His airbags deployed; he did not lose consciousness and was able to self-extricate from the vehicle. After extrication, he started to experience substernal chest pressure, which was not present prior to the accident. When EMS arrived he was placed in a cervical collar and given aspirin, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained (). He was transported to the ED.\n",
      "On arrival, a repeat ECG was performed, and the emergency physician alerted a cardiac activation given concern for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He complained of substernal chest pain and pressure that was non-radiating and exacerbated by deep inspiration. Additional review of systems was negative.\n",
      "On examination in the ED, the patient’s temperature was 36.6° Celsius, heart rate 76 beats per minute, respirations 15 breaths per minute, blood pressure 102/60 millimeters mercury, and an oxygen saturation of 97%. He was in no acute distress. He had tenderness to palpation over the sternum with no evidence of contusion or seatbelt sign on chest or abdomen. He had no abnormalities on cardiac, lung, or abdominal exams. He had no bony point tenderness of extremities and had full range of motion of all extremities.\n",
      "He had no prior medical history but had not had regular medical care in the prior 30 years. He had smoked 1.5 packs per day of cigarettes for many years, consumed alcohol on social occasions, and denied recreational drug use. He had no known drug allergies. He had never had surgery. He denied any family history of coronary artery disease and denied any personal history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or coronary artery disease.\n",
      "Chest radiography demonstrated only mild left lung base atelectasis. Point-of-care echocardiography by the cardiology service was limited by difficult windows and pain on transducer pressure, but demonstrated a relatively preserved ejection fraction, no pericardial effusion, and no obvious wall motion abnormalities. Initial troponin-I was elevated at 0.045 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) (reference range 0.02–0.04 ng/mL), and B-type natriuretic peptide was 10 picograms (pg)/mL (<=99 pg/mL).\n",

With no contraindications to angiography identified, the patient was fully anticoagulated and taken emergently for coronary angiography. Coronary angiogram demonstration 100% occlusion of the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) without dissection (). There was also a mid-right coronary artery (RCA) ragged 70–90% lesion. After intervention on the LAD lesion, the patient’s pain subsided. The next day, he complained of chest pain on deep inspiration and chest heaviness.

Point-of-care echocardiography by the cardiology service was limited by difficult windows and pain on transducer pressure, but demonstrated a relatively preserved ejection fraction, no pericardial effusion, and no obvious wall motion abnormalities. Initial troponin-I was elevated at 0.045 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) (reference range 0.02–0.04 ng/mL), and B-type natriuretic peptide was 10 picograms (pg)/mL (<=99 pg/mL).\n",
      "While the diagnosis of cardiac contusion was entertained, the field ECG could not be ignored. With no contraindications to angiography identified, the patient was fully anticoagulated and taken emergently for coronary angiography. Coronary angiogram demonstration 100% occlusion of the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) without dissection (). There was also a mid-right coronary artery (RCA) ragged 70–90% lesion. After intervention on the LAD lesion, the patient’s pain subsided. The next day, he complained of chest pain on deep inspiration and chest heaviness. He had a staged intervention of the RCA the following day. In the interim, he was discovered to have a sternal fracture by computed tomography ().\n",

      "A 71-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension presented to our community emergency department (ED) transported by emergency medical services (EMS) with the chief complaints of chest pain, difficulty breathing, back pain, and weakness of both lower extremities. He had an abrupt onset of chest pain, described as a sharp and stabbing pain, while using his rototiller in the garden, 6 h prior to arrival. His symptoms continued to progress to the point that he was having difficulty breathing and starting to have trouble walking for which EMS was called. Per EMS, they noted rapidly progressing symptoms while en route to the ED. Vitals on arrival to the ED are as follows: 94.5 °F, blood pressure of 91/64 mmHg, heart rate of 109 beats/min, respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min, and 100% pulse oximetry on room air. On physical exam, he was toxic appearing, in acute distress, and diaphoretic. Jugular venous distention was present. Cardiopulmonary exam was notable for tachycardia, distant heart sounds, and the presence of bibasilar rales. His skin/lower extremities were pale, mottled, and he was unable to move them. Carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally, radial pules 1+ bilaterally, femoral pulses 1+ bilaterally, with absent popliteal pulses. On neurological exam, he had dysarthric speech, left-sided facial droop, and loss of strength and sensation in his lower extremities.\n",
      "The patient was placed on non-invasive positive pressure. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia with premature atrial complexes, a right bundle branch block, with non-specific ST/T wave changes in the anterior leads. Portable chest radiography taken in an upright position (Fig. ) demonstrated a widened mediastinum at about 10.5 cm. A bedside point of care cardiac ultrasound revealed a significant pericardial effusion. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast was unremarkable for any acute process. Pertinent laboratory evaluation:\n",
      "Hemoglobin of 9.2 (13.5–17 g/dL) Arterial blood gas: pH 7.01, pCO2 45, p02 116, HCO3 12 Initial lactic acid of 8.3 (0.5–2.2 mmol/L) that increased to 14.8 Blood/urea/nitrogen of 42 (8–22 mg/dL) Creatinine of 3.06 (0.6–1.4 mg/dL).\n",
      "CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast revealed a Stanford type A dissection with an intimal tear beginning at the level of the aortic root and extending throughout the course of the thoracic aorta and into the abdominal aorta (Figs. , , and ). Additional findings on CT included involvement of the origins of the great vessels (brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery). Hemopericardium is visualized with high suspicion for pericardial tamponade. There is dilation of the ascending thoracic aorta measuring up to 5.2 cm. The dissection continues distally (Figs. and ) to involve the left common iliac artery and bilateral external iliac arteries.\n",
      "He was transferred emergently to a tertiary center and was taken immediately to the operating room for definitive repair. The patient underwent sternotomy, repair of Stanford type A dissection with right groin cannulation, and repair of the right femoral artery and vein. He arrived in the surgical intensive care unit in guarded condition, his sternotomy was left open secondary to severe coagulopathy intraoperatively, and he was on an epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin infusion. By day 2, continuous renal replacement therapy (CCRT) was initiated for acute tubular necrosis. Vascular surgery was consulted to evaluate a pulseless right lower extremity status post right femoral artery cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass. Given the patient had an open sternotomy with five chest tubes with significant output requiring transfusion of multiple blood products throughout the night, vascular surgery could not perform a femoral-femoral bypass or axillofemoral bypass without heparinization.\n",
      "By day 3, he underwent mediastinal irrigation and sternal closure with cardiothoracic surgery. He was then taken for a right common femoral endarterectomy, iliofemoral and lower extremity embolectomy, and right lower extremity four-compartment fasciotomy secondary to acute ischemia of the right lower extremity. In addition, neurosurgery evaluated the patient because he was not spontaneously moving his extremities after surgery and there was concern that the dissection had caused an infarction of his thoracic spinal cord, resulting in paraplegia. By day 4, he remained stuporous off sedation and on maximum pressor support (norepinephrine infusion at 30 mcg/min, epinephrine infusion at 10 mcg/min, and a vasopressin infusion at 0.04 units/min). He continued to have upper extremity non-epileptic myoclonic jerks secondary to continued renal failure. CT of the head revealed multiple 1 to 2 cm foci consistent with likely subacute infarcts related to embolic disease. By day 5, a family discussion was had regarding a poor neurological prognosis for independent neurological recovery with likely permanent cognitive and motor deficits. His code status was subsequently changed to do not resuscitate (DNR) with no further escalation of care. The patient continued to deteriorate throughout the night, became asystolic, and expired.\n",

Initial blood pressure was 163/91 mmHg, pulse rate was 114 beats/min, respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min, and body temperature was 38℃. Oxygen saturation was initially detected as 87%, and increased to 95% upon oxygen supplement via nasal cannula at 5 L/min. Following oxygen supplementation, arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40.9 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 113.7 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%.\n",

Patchy consolidation with ground-glass opacity in both lower lung zones was noticed in the initial chest radiography ().\n",
      "During the initial workup, the patient became progressively tachypneic with increased oxygen demand to 15 L/min via facial mask. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and oxygen supply was increased to 100% by high-flow nasal cannula. Despite supplementation, PaO2 levels remained low (49.9 mmHg) leading to a diagnosis of ARDS, and then the patient underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation.\n",
      "Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed marked eosinophilia (187/200 evaluated cells, 93.5% eosinophils). Skin biopsy of the right ankle showed diffuse eosinophilic perivascular infiltration of the dermis () and eosinophilic abscess of subcutaneous fat (). Duplex sonography revealed deep vein thrombosis in the left popliteal, soleal, and peroneal veins. Nerve conduction test and electromyography showed neuropathy in the right posterior tibial nerve.\n",
      "A diagnosis of IHES was reached based on the presence of peripheral and tissue eosinophilia, along with the exclusion of other causes of eosinophilia. High-dose corticosteroid (methylprednisone 1 mg/kg/day) therapy was initiated on the first day of admission. By day 3, eosinophil counts decreased to the normal range (). Extubation was performed on day 4 as a result of clinical and radiological improvements.\n",
      "A chest CT scan was obtained on day 9 to evaluate symptoms of mild dyspnea despite the dramatic improvement seen by simple radiography (). Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) was detected in the bilateral lobar and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries (), and we started anticoagulant therapy. On day 23, the patient was discharged from the hospital with a gradual tapering of corticosteroids.\n",

      "A 71-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department after being found unconscious and hypoxemic in front of his house. He had a history of alcohol- and nicotine-abuse and lived a reclusive life. One week prior he had visited his general practitioner because of dyspnea. He was prescribed oral steroids and bronchodilators for presumed exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n",
      "On physical examination he looked ill, was haemodynamically stable and hypercapnic. His body temperature was 37.2 °C. His blood pressure was 154/66 mmHg, with a regular pulse of 116 beats min−1. He was tachypneic, respiration rate of 27 min−1, with a peripheral oxygen saturation of 97 % with a non-rebreathing mask. Lung auscultation revealed weak breath sounds. Further physical examination revealed a wound between his first and second toe on his right foot in which a great number of maggots were present (). Signs of chronic venous insufficiency were present, but no signs of arterial insufficiency. The remaining physical examination was unremarkable. Haematological and biochemical investigations showed a white blood cell count of 17.9×109 l−1[reference range (ref.) 4–10×109 l−1], with 81 % neutrophils (ref. 40–75 %), C-reactive protein 51 mg l−1 (ref. <10), glucose level of 257.6 mg dl−1 (ref. 72.1–115.1) and otherwise normal results for haemoglobin level, platelet count, liver enzymes, electrolytes and creatinine. Arterial blood-gas analysis showed a marked respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.19 and pCO2 of 12.1 kPa. A chest X-ray did not reveal signs of pneumonia. He was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit and non-invasive ventilation was started with a diagnosis of exacerbation of his COPD without an apparent trigger, possibly upper respiratory tract infection. Steroids, bronchodilators and a broad-spectrum antibiotic (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) were given. Two days later he was transferred to the pulmonology ward. Two blood culture sets each containing one aerobic and one anaerobic bottle (BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F and Anaerobic/F Culture Vials using the BACTEC FX system; Becton Dickinson) drawn upon admission revealed growth of Gram-negative rods in one of the aerobic bottles after incubation for 48 h. Upon subculturing of the Gram-negative rod, an oxidase-positive, aerobic, catalase-positive strain was found. Determination by Vitek2Combo with ID-GN card (bioMérieux) revealed Acinetobacter iwoffii with 98 % probabil ity. API NE tests (bioMérieux) could not assign the strain to a specific species. The above results were conflicting with colony morphology and oxidase reaction. A RapID-ANA test (Remel) was done to test for enzymatic reactions that could possibly provide a clue to the identification. Positive reactions for urease, arginine and serine hydrolysis were found. Although we even considered this strain to be a non-fermentative contaminant, the combination of the positive oxidase reaction and the growth characteristics finally let us consider Wohlfahrtiimonas species as we knew the patient had a wound full with maggots. However , a positive urease reaction is not compatible with Wohlfahrtiimonas. We offered the strain to an external laboratory (BaseClear, Leiden, The Netherlands) for identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (VITEK MS; bioMérieux) and MicroSEQ analysis, a 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing method (Life Technologies). MALDI-TOF MS did not reveal a reliable result (VITEK MS industry database v2.0) and even the MicroSEQ analysis with the validated database was unsuccessful. To our complete surprise a species of the genusIgnatzschineria was identified when the 489 basepair 16S rRNA gene sequence was blasted against the NCBI and SMARTgene databases. The colony morphology, growth characteristics, oxidase and urease reaction were all compatible with this identification as well as the clinical story. The complete 16S rRNA gene was amplified and analysed. The resulting sequence (1392 nucleotides) showed 98.7, 98.5 and 98.2 % similarity, respectively to the type strains of Ignatzschineria ureiclastica, Ignatzschineria larvae and Ignatzschineria indica (GenBank accession numbers , and ). shows a phylogenetic tree displaying the relations with close proximate species. The sequence was submitted to the GenBank database and assigned accession number . Antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed by Etest (bioMérieux) revealed minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid of 0.25 mg l−1, amoxicillin 0.047 mg l−1 and ciprofloxacin 0.064 mg l−1. A beta-lactamase test (Oxoid) was positive. According to EUCAST non-species related breakpoints all these antibiotics could be considered sensitive based on Pk/Pd data. The positive beta-lactamase test argues against amoxicillin as appropriate treatment. The in vitro sensitivity to amoxicillin by Etest in conjunction with a positive beta-lactamase test is suggestive of an inducible beta-lactamase. A culture of the wound on the right foot of the patient taken two days after start of antimicrobial treatment and admission did only reveal Providencia stuartii. Even with the knowledge of the blood culture result we could not find species of the genus Ignatzschineria in this culture. A two-week course of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was completed with good clinical response. The wound on the patient's foot was successfully treated with application of povidone-iodine (betadine) and low adherent highly absorbent (melonin) dressings. His pulmonary condition improved, elevated glucose level and venous insufficiency were taken care of and he gradually improved and was discharged three weeks after admission.\n",

On arrival at the hospital, he was hypoxemic, with a SpO2 of 91% and a respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute requiring ambient oxygen therapy with a flow of 15 L/min via a non-rebreather mask. Hemodynamically, he showed a stable profile with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 84 bpm. His body temperature was 38.1°C. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated C-reactive protein concentration of 37 mg/L (reference: <5 mg/L), a leukocyte count of 7.7 × 109/L (reference: 4–10 × 109/L) and D-dimer of 0.41 mg/L (reference: <0.50 mg/L). The chest radiograph demonstrated bilateral basal consolidations. The suspicion of Covid-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples.\n",
      "The patient was primarily admitted to a designated Covid-19 ward for further observation and oxygen therapy. Due to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure within 24 h after admission, he was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he was intubated. On the 5th day of ICU admission (T0), the patient developed a high fever accompanied with an increase in inflammatory parameters (). Hemodynamic parameters did not indicate an unstable course (). Microcirculatory monitoring was carried out sublingually using Cytocam-IDF imaging (CytoCam, Braedius Medical, Huizen, The Netherlands). Image analysis which was performed offline using MicroTools, showed an increase in microcirculatory density (total vessel density and perfused vessel density) and perfusion parameters (proportion of perfused vessels and microvascular mean flow index) as well as in red blood cell (RBC) velocity (). Subsequent CT-scan demonstrated extensive subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum as well as a thrombus in the right jugular vein extending to the superior vena cava and into the right brachial vein (). A tracheal defect was ruled out by bronchoscopy. There was no pneumothorax or evidence of esophageal rupture.\n",
      "The patient was ventilated for 19 days and a temporary tracheostomy was performed for a gradual wean from the ventilator. Unfractionated heparin was given in therapeutic doses for his venous thrombus. Chest CT obtained at 19th (T1) and 25th day of ICU admission (T2) showed complete resorption of mediastinal air and venous thrombus (). Concurrent microcirculatory images revealed a recovery of microcirculatory alterations ( and ). Thereupon on the 30th day of ICU admission, the tracheostomy was removed and the patient was discharged to the ward after 32 days of ICU stay in stable hemodynamic and respiratory condition.\n",

Due to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure within 24 h after admission, he was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he was intubated. On the 5th day of ICU admission (T0), the patient developed a high fever accompanied with an increase in inflammatory parameters (). Hemodynamic parameters did not indicate an unstable course (). Microcirculatory monitoring was carried out sublingually using Cytocam-IDF imaging (CytoCam, Braedius Medical, Huizen, The Netherlands). Image analysis which was performed offline using MicroTools, showed an increase in microcirculatory density (total vessel density and perfused vessel density) and perfusion parameters (proportion of perfused vessels and microvascular mean flow index) as well as in red blood cell (RBC) velocity (). Subsequent CT-scan demonstrated extensive subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum as well as a thrombus in the right jugular vein extending to the superior vena cava and into the right brachial vein (). A tracheal defect was ruled out by bronchoscopy. There was no pneumothorax or evidence of esophageal rupture.\n",
      "The patient was ventilated for 19 days and a temporary tracheostomy was performed for a gradual wean from the ventilator. Unfractionated heparin was given in therapeutic doses for his venous thrombus. Chest CT obtained at 19th (T1) and 25th day of ICU admission (T2) showed complete resorption of mediastinal air and venous thrombus (). Concurrent microcirculatory images revealed a recovery of microcirculatory alterations ( and ). Thereupon on the 30th day of ICU admission, the tracheostomy was removed and the patient was discharged to the ward after 32 days of ICU stay in stable hemodynamic and respiratory condition.\n",

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 26-year-old Somalian woman (Gravida 2, Para 1) who had been living in Sweden for a year presented at the Emergency Department of Skåne University Hospital in Malmö on April 17th, 2020 pregnant at 32 + 1 weeks of gestation. She was transferred to the Infectious Diseases Department with suspicion of COVID-19. A diagnostic test, based on quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), from a nasopharyngeal swab, was positive for SARS-CoV-2.\n",
      "She had recently moved from Stockholm to Malmö. In 2015 she had a normal vaginal delivery in Somalia. The patient had an appendectomy and a cholecystectomy in Somalia. Her medical history also included hypothyroidism, currently treated with 150 ug Levothyroxine daily. The body mass index (BMI) on admission to prenatal care was 47 kg/m2 with length 163 centimetres (cm), weight 126 kg (kg). Apart from the obesity, her pregnancy had been without complications. She had received an intramuscular injection of Anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 + 5 weeks of gestation since she was Rhesus D (RhD) negative and the fetus was RhD positive.\n",
      "On admission, the patient described a nine-day history of shortness of breath, dry cough, myalgia, nausea, abdominal pain and fever (Fig. 1). She had significant abdominal pain on admission but the surgeon did not find any signs of an acute abdominal event. The patient had also noticed reduced fetal movements for the last two days. Obstetric examination including cardio-tocography (CTG) and an abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormalities.\n",
      "The patient’s respiratory rate was 22 breaths/minute, oxygen saturation 95%, blood pressure 116/71, pulse 113 beats/minute and temperature 37.2 degrees Celsius (oC). The laboratory tests are shown in Table . The patient was given morphine, paracetamol and oxycodone for pain relief and also received thromboprophylaxis, Dalteparin 7500 units /day subcutaneously. No additional oxygen was needed.\n",
      "On day 2 (18/4/2020), the patient was relatively stable apart from two short episodes of fever up to 38.9 oC. Due to risk for preterm labour, the patient received 12 milligrams (mg) of Betamethasone intramuscularly to aid fetal lung maturity. Daily fetal monitoring using CTG showed no signs of fetal distress.\n",
      "The patient was discharged on day 3 (19/4/2020) with a planned obstetric follow-up including fetal growth assessment after recovery. She was prescribed dalteparin for four weeks.\n",
      "The patient returned to the Emergency Department the next day (20/4/2020) with a sore throat and severe difficulties in swallowing. Apart from tachypnoea (25–35 breaths/minute) and tachycardia (118 beats/minute), other vital signs were normal. After examination, she was discharged with a prescription of Betamethasone tablets for three days (6, 4 and 3 mg) for swallowing difficulties and potassium supplements for the hypokalaemia noted in the blood tests (Table ).\n",
      "The patient was readmitted to the Infectious Diseases Department the next day (21/4/2020) (Fig. ). Her COVID-19 symptoms (cough, myalgia, abdominal pain and fever) had worsened and she now presented with dyspnoea. At readmission, the patient’s respiratory rate 42 breaths/minute, blood pressure 114/61, pulse was 120 beats/minute and temperature 38.9 oC. During episodes of coughing, her oxygen saturation fell to 86%, but with 5 L of oxygen on mask the saturation rose to 99%. Laboratory tests are shown in Table .\n",
      "Her condition deteriorated on day 2 (22/4/2020) of the readmission. In addition to the generalized pain and tenderness, the pain in her right upper abdomen had worsened. Blood tests showed elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ferritin concentrations. There was impaired coagulation as shown by a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), high D-dimer, falling platelet count and decreased level of Anti-thrombin III (Table ). Hemolysis was indicated by a fall in the hemoglobin concentration and rising lactate dehydrogenase levels although haptoglobin concentrations only were slightly elevated (Table ). Despite her worsening condition, the patient felt active fetal movements and normal intermittent CTG controls were registered. Intravenous antibiotic treatment with Cefotaxime (2 g, 3 times daily) was initiated due to suspicion of concomitant bacterial infection (Table ). Blood and urine cultures were taken but since the general condition of the patient had worsened, a decision was made to deliver by Caesarean section (32 + 6 gestational weeks), on maternal indication. The operation was performed in spinal analgesia in an operating theatre with negative air ventilation. The local hospital guidelines were followed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 []. An uncomplicated operation was completed within 40 min and the total blood loss was 200 millilitres (mL).\n",
      "After two hours in the post-operative unit, the patient returned to the ward and received thromboprophylaxis, dalteparin at a total dose of 10.000 units divided in two doses. A computed tomography (CT) lung scan, performed later the same day, showed bilateral diffuse, ground-glass opacities with both peripheral and perihilar distribution, but no signs of pulmonary embolism (Fig. ).\n",
      "Due to deranged liver values, the patient was unable to receive paracetamol and due to the COVID-19 infection not able to receive ibuprofen []. The pain relief was managed by administering 2.5 mL of intravenous morphine as needed. However, the patient’s condition worsened during the night and on examination, the patient was somnolent and lethargic but answered adequately when woken up (Reaction Level Scale 2). The patient’s pain was mostly localized to the upper right quadrant of the abdomen and epigastrium. Her uterus was well contracted and there were no signs of postoperative complications such as bleedings and local infection. On examination, the patient had miotic pupils that reacted poorly to light stimulation. Even though the patient only was given 7.5 mg of morphine over the course of 8 h, a morphine over-dose was suspected, and intravenous morphine was replaced by a combination of orally administered Naloxone and Oxycodone. Post-operative mobilization was initiated one day after surgery where after the patient made a steady recovery.\n",
      "Table illustrates the drastic improvement in the patient’s blood tests on day 3 (23/4/2020) of the readmission. The patient was discharged in good health on the 30th of April, 2020 with thromboprophylaxis planned for 6 weeks postpartum and a follow-up visit to the Obstetrics Clinic.\n",
      "A male baby was delivered with birth weight 2085 g (37th percentile), birth length 48 cm (99th percentile) and head circumference 33.5 cm (99th percentile). The cord was clamped immediately after birth and the baby was shown briefly to the mother before being taken to a neonatal resuscitation station. At 1-minute after delivery, the baby had a normal heart rate but was gasping and had absent tone and no spontaneous movements. Positive pressure ventilation by a T-piece (neopuff) was given with peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) 20 cmH2O and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) between 5 and 7 cmH2O intermittently during the first seven minutes of life. At ten minutes, the baby was spontaneously breathing, albeit grunting, through T-piece continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with preductal oxygen saturation between 90–95% at FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) 0.4. Fine crackles could be heard on lung auscultation. Intermittent intercostal retractions were also seen. Skin colour, tone and reflex irritability improved gradually during the stabilisation process. Apgar score; 1 min: 4 (appearance 1, pulse 2, reflex irritability 0, activity 1, respiration 0), 5 min: 6 (appearance 1, pulse 2, reflex irritability 1, activity 1, respiration 1), 10 min: 8 (appearance 2, pulse 2, reflex irritability 1, activity 1, respiration 2). Vitamin K was given intramuscularly and a nasogastric tube was inserted. Nasal CPAP with PEEP 6 cmH2O was started.\n",
      "Arterial umbilical cord blood gas showed mild combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis with pH 7.28, partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) 3.45 (kilopascal) kPa, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) 6.97 kPa and base excess − 6.8.\n",
      "The baby was put in an incubator and transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) with negative pressure ventilation. It was given preterm formula supplemented with intravenous glucose infusion. Venous blood gas was analysed at 4 h of age: pH 7.27, pO2 5 kPa, pCO2 7.3 kPa, BE -1.8, Hb 184 g/l and lactate 2.7 mmol/l.\n",
      "After parental consent, formula was changed to donated breast milk. The mother was supplied with a breast pump and instructed in its use. After the initial need of breathing support and supplemental oxygen during day one of life the baby has enjoyed an uneventful clinical course. Nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection were collected at 48 and 96 h of life and were found to be negative in both instances.\n",

      "This study presents a case of a 21-year-old male patient with T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma status post induction chemotherapy with lineage switch to acute myelogenous leukemia. He received high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation (TBI), and later received a matched unrelated donor blood stem cell transplantation. His post-transplant course was complicated by biopsy proven chronic graft-versus-host disease in the gastrointestinal tract requiring daily steroid use. He also developed Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis, BK virus-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, Candida glabrata fungemia, and Streptococcus viridans bacteremia-all of which were appropriately treated and resolved.\n",
      "Eleven months after his stem cell transplant, he presented with acute onset of copious blood-tinged phlegm, shortness of breath and left pleuritic chest pain. Upon initial evaluation, the patient was afebrile, respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute, pulse 180 beats per minute, blood pressure 90/67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 91% on room air. Broad-spectrum antibiotics including intravenous vancomycin and antifungals were started. The patient later was hypotensive with blood pressure of 70/46 despite aggressive intravenous hydration. Due to septic shock, intravenous norepinephrine drip was started in the intensive care unit. Laboratory studies were significant for pancytopenia with white blood cell count of 2.79 x 103 cells/µL. Intravenous steroids were started given septic shock and patient’s known history of chronic steroid use due to chronic GVHD. Electrolytes and renal function were unremarkable. Arterial blood gas was significant for PaO2 of 64 mmHg. Blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA). A chest CT scan as seen in Figure showed left lower lobe consolidation in the setting of multiple bilateral cavitary nodules.\n",
      "The infectious disease service was consulted. Blood cultures grew methicillin resistant Staphyloccocus aureus. Given the patient had not been hospitalized recently, it was determined that he had community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) bacteremia. Bronchoscopy was done and was remarkable for the presence of purulent secretions in the tracheobronchial tree. Respiratory culture from bronchoscopy also grew methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The rest of the infectious workup from the bronchoscopy was unremarkable. A transthoracic echocardiogram was ordered to evaluate for the possibility of endocarditis. The echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%, mild global hypokinesis, and no evidence of vegetation suggestive of endocarditis. After a few days of treatment, the patient had significant clinical improvement and blood cultures were negative. He was discharged with a two week course of intravenous vancomycin which he completed.\n",
      "Two months later, the patient was admitted to the hospital for fevers, productive cough with green sputum, and shortness of breath. He was found to have recurrent MRSA bacteremia and recurrent MRSA pneumonia. The CT chest findings as seen in Figure showed multiple bilateral cavitary nodules consistent with a necrotizing process.\n",
      "Initially, intravenous vancomycin was started, however this was later switched to intravenous linezolid. This was done because the patient had recurrent MRSA bacteremia despite prior intravenous vancomycin therapy. Blood cultures were negative after two days of treatment. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an improved left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-70% and no vegetations were identified. After clinical improvement, the patient was discharged on oral linezolid for six weeks per infectious disease team recommendations. After completing this course he was placed on prophylaxis with oral doxycycline to prevent further CA-MRSA infections.\n",
      "Six months later, he had a repeat CT of the chest as seen in Figure . This CT showed the presence of permanent pneumatoceles from the focal loss of lung parenchyma.\n",

      "This study presents a case of a 21-year-old male patient with T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma status post induction chemotherapy with lineage switch to acute myelogenous leukemia. He received high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation (TBI), and later received a matched unrelated donor blood stem cell transplantation. His post-transplant course was complicated by biopsy proven chronic graft-versus-host disease in the gastrointestinal tract requiring daily steroid use. He also developed Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis, BK virus-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, Candida glabrata fungemia, and Streptococcus viridans bacteremia-all of which were appropriately treated and resolved.\n",
      "Eleven months after his stem cell transplant, he presented with acute onset of copious blood-tinged phlegm, shortness of breath and left pleuritic chest pain. Upon initial evaluation, the patient was afebrile, respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute, pulse 180 beats per minute, blood pressure 90/67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 91% on room air. Broad-spectrum antibiotics including intravenous vancomycin and antifungals were started. The patient later was hypotensive with blood pressure of 70/46 despite aggressive intravenous hydration. Due to septic shock, intravenous norepinephrine drip was started in the intensive care unit. Laboratory studies were significant for pancytopenia with white blood cell count of 2.79 x 103 cells/µL. Intravenous steroids were started given septic shock and patient’s known history of chronic steroid use due to chronic GVHD. Electrolytes and renal function were unremarkable. Arterial blood gas was significant for PaO2 of 64 mmHg. Blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA). A chest CT scan as seen in Figure showed left lower lobe consolidation in the setting of multiple bilateral cavitary nodules.\n",
      "The infectious disease service was consulted. Blood cultures grew methicillin resistant Staphyloccocus aureus. Given the patient had not been hospitalized recently, it was determined that he had community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) bacteremia. Bronchoscopy was done and was remarkable for the presence of purulent secretions in the tracheobronchial tree. Respiratory culture from bronchoscopy also grew methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The rest of the infectious workup from the bronchoscopy was unremarkable. A transthoracic echocardiogram was ordered to evaluate for the possibility of endocarditis. The echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%, mild global hypokinesis, and no evidence of vegetation suggestive of endocarditis. After a few days of treatment, the patient had significant clinical improvement and blood cultures were negative. He was discharged with a two week course of intravenous vancomycin which he completed.\n",
      "Two months later, the patient was admitted to the hospital for fevers, productive cough with green sputum, and shortness of breath. He was found to have recurrent MRSA bacteremia and recurrent MRSA pneumonia. The CT chest findings as seen in Figure showed multiple bilateral cavitary nodules consistent with a necrotizing process.\n",
      "Initially, intravenous vancomycin was started, however this was later switched to intravenous linezolid. This was done because the patient had recurrent MRSA bacteremia despite prior intravenous vancomycin therapy. Blood cultures were negative after two days of treatment. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an improved left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-70% and no vegetations were identified. After clinical improvement, the patient was discharged on oral linezolid for six weeks per infectious disease team recommendations. After completing this course he was placed on prophylaxis with oral doxycycline to prevent further CA-MRSA infections.\n",
      "Six months later, he had a repeat CT of the chest as seen in Figure . This CT showed the presence of permanent pneumatoceles from the focal loss of lung parenchyma.\n",

      "57-year old man presented to emergency department of regional hospital with chest pain, which started after walking in the morning. Dull pain was localized in the middle of his chest and was accompanied with nausea, fatigue and difficult breathing.\n",
      "He had no history of heart problems, but was a former smoker and had elevated cholesterol levels. During last summer, he noticed varicose veins on right groin and was wearing elastic bandage. He had no history of cardiovascular disease, took no medications, had no known allergies and was in good physical condition. His father died at the age of 80 due to cerebrovascular insult and his mother had pulmonary embolism at the age of 74.\n",
      "Since chest pain, dyspnea and fatigue didn't subside he called an ambulance. Upon arrival to emergency department he was pale and hypotensive (102/60 mmHg), heart rate was 100 b.p.m. and respiratory rate 22 breaths/min. Oxygen saturation was 95% while breathing 100% oxygen. His body temperature was 36.6 C°. Beside varicose veins on right groin, his physical examination was unremarkable.\n",
      "On 12-lead ECG there was sinus rhythm with incomplete right bundle branch block, ST segment elevations up to 3 mm in precordial leads V1-V4 and negative T wave in lead III (Figure ).\n",
      "On the basis of ECG changes and clinical presentation, acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was suspected. After receiving aspirin 500 mg, morphine 5 mg i.v., thiethylperazine, unfractionated heparin 5000 IU i.v. and nitroglycerin sublingually, he was immediately transferred to our University medical center for primary coronary intervention (PCI). In case of STEMI, quick referral from local hospital or directly from the field, to catheterisation laboratory is a standard of care in Slovenia. That is why no further diagnostic procedures, which would delay transport to PCI were performed in regional hospital.\n",

      "A 74-year-old normotensive, nondiabetic, male smoker (30-pack years) presented with progressively increasing shortness of breath, cough, white, mucoid expectoration, and retrosternal and right sided parasternal, oppressive chest pain for last 2 months. Chest pain and shortness of breath were increased in severity on exertion and were associated with palpitation, but there is no history of sweating, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, unconsciousness, and convulsion. There was no radiation of chest pain. Chest pain was suddenly increased for last five days and the patient was admitted in the emergency department with a suspicion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). There was no history of fever, hemoptysis, leg swelling, and facial puffiness. History of significant weight loss and anorexia were present. There was no history of household contact with the patient of sputum smear positive tuberculosis. The patient received formoterol + tiotropium metered dose inhaler (2 puffs once daily with spacer) and oral doxofylline (400 mg twice daily) for last five years, as he suffered from chronic bronchitis predominant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which resulted in persistent breathlessness, cough, and expectoration.\n",
      "General survey revealed anemia and clubbing, but there was no cyanosis, edema, and engorged neck vein. There were multiple cervical and supraclavicular enlarged lymph nodes on left side, which were hard in consistency, discrete, nontender, and fixed to underlying structure, but not fixed to overlying skin, and there was no discharging sinus. His temperature was 37°C, respiratory rate 24 breaths/minute, pulse rate 120 beats/minute, regular blood pressure 94/64 mmHg, oxygen saturation in capillary blood (SpO2) 96% @ room air, and FiO2 0.21.\n",
      "Examination of respiratory system revealed no abnormality, except vesicular breath sound with prolonged expiration on both sides, bilateral crackles, mainly over the bases of the lungs, and occasional wheezes. Examination of other system was normal. Complete hemogram showed anemia with hemoglobin concentration of 7.1 g/dL. Blood biochemistry was normal. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atypical ST segment elevation and T wave inversion in lateral chest leads (Lead V4, Lead V5, and Lead V6). Initial rapid troponin-t-test was inconclusive, but repeat one after 12 hours of first test was negative. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and Gram stain was negative, and pyogenic culture of sputum showed no growth. Chest X-ray posteroanterior (PA view) showed cardiothoracic ratio was more than 0.5; that is, size of the cardiac silhouette was increased, but lung parenchyma was normal. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of thorax showed a large, nonhomogenous mass lesion in right lower lobe which invaded the left atrium and was compressing the adjacent ventricular walls (). There was also mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. CT-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed discrete clusters of malignant epithelial cells which showed nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, high nucleocytoplasmic ratio, pale cytoplasm, and ill-defined cell boundary—suggestive of non-small-cell carcinoma, possibly squamous cell variety (). FNAC of left sided supraclavicular lymph nodes showed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Sputum for malignant cell was negative and fibre optic bronchoscopy did not show any abnormality. Echocardiogram showed a large echogenic mass of 15 × 12 mm, attached to the roof of the left atrium adjacent to right pulmonary venous openings, encroaching to interatrial septum, an extension of the tumour from adjacent lung parenchyma. Ejection fraction was 66%. Ultrasound of abdomen and CECT scan of brain were normal. Hence the diagnosis was a non-small-cell carcinoma of lower lobe of right lung with invasion of the left atrium and compression of adjacent ventricular wall (T4 disease) with contralateral supraclavicular metastatic lymphadenopathy (N3 disease).

      "A 57-year-old Caucasian male was brought to our emergency department (ED) following an allergic reaction (flushing, chest rash, and drop in blood pressure [BP] to 90/60 mm Hg) to intravenous (i.v.) amiodarone administered by the emergency medical service (EMS) to treat atrial fibrillation. Upon admission, he was anxious and complained of palpitations. He had a history of palpitations and experienced several episodes of irregular heart rhythm following lack of sleep, or periods of work-related stress. He had arterial hypertension for 2 years, and was regularly taking his prescribed medication (5 mg ramipril and 5 mg amlodipine). In his family history, there were no serious diseases and cardiovascular emergencies. His palpitations started 6 hours before presenting to the EMS. An electrocardiogram (ECG) at the EMS showed AF with fast ventricular response (125 bpm). Blood pressure was 180/110 mm Hg and physical examination showed no abnormalities other than irregular heart rhythm on auscultation. He was administered 300 mg amiodarone in 250 mL 5% dextrose solution, and in a matter of minutes had a drop in BP, a rash appeared on his chest, and he complained of flushing. Amiodarone was stopped, and 150 mg propafenone in 250 mL 5% dextrose solution i.v. was admistered as an alternative. This attempt at cardioversion was unsuccessful, and he was transferred to our ED.\n",
      "Upon arrival to our ED he was agitated and complained of palpitations. His physical examination findings were unremarkable other than irregular heart rhythm on heart auscultation.\n",
      "His BP was 130/80 mm Hg, pulse above 125 bpm, pulse oximeter showed 98% oxygenation. His body mass index was 29.2 kg/m2, body temperature 36.7°C. The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with an average ventricular response of 107 bpm. He had left electrical axis and left anterior fascicular block. There were no signs of accessory electrical conduction pathway in ECG. There were no radiological or clinical signs of cardiac decompensation, and we ruled out acute coronary or pulmoembolic syndrome. We performed both transtoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, which showed structurally normal heart with normal heart cavities and good systolic function of the left ventricle, with no visible thrombus. He was on telemetry monitoring during the index hospitalization. After having ruled out immediate and life-threatening causes, such as cardiac ischemia, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary embolism, other possible causes of paroxysmal AF were considered. The common causes of atrial fibrillation are well known, and diagnostic tests revealed no underlying structural heart disease. Thyrotoxicosis was excluded and there were no electrolyte disorders.\n",
      "According to AF treatment guidelines and patient workup results, we decided for rhythm-control strategy rather than rate-control strategy since paroxysmal FA lasted less than 48 hours. Propafenone was prescribed in an oral dose of 150 mg twice a day, bisoprolol 2.5 mg in the morning, and standard thromboprophylaxis with nadroparine 0.8 ml subcutaneously once a day. A betablocator was excluded from therapy due to AF with bradycardic ventricular response (<60 bpm), and a drop of arterial BP to 105/75 mm Hg. He was very anxious and experienced palpitations, therefore we decided to treat him with acupuncture before performing a transesophageal ultrasound. He was scheduled for electrocardioversion for the upcoming day. Acupuncture was administered by a physician accredited at the Croatian Society for Acupuncture, a member of the International Council of Medical Acupuncture and Related Techniques. He was stimulated bilaterally with acupuncture needles (Tewa coated needle PB 2540, 0.25 × 40 mm) at 3 acupuncture points (HT-7, ST-36 and PC-6). Manual stimulation of the acupuncture point was performed until “De-Qui” effect (sensation of numbness, distension, or electrical tingling at the needling site) was produced, and then needles were left for 25 minutes. There was an instant drop of ventricular response rate during treatment and 2 hours after acupuncture therapy cardioversion to sinus rhythm occurred. There was no significant drop of arterial BP during or after acupuncture therapy. He received additional ambulatory acupuncture therapy during 10 treatments every third day in addition to propafenone at peroral dose of 300 mg twice a day. No anticoagulation was recommended due to CHA2DS2-VASC score of zero (0). He was urged to minimize work-related stress and keep a diary of his symptoms.\n",
      "Twenty-four-hour Holter ECG performed after one month showed sinus rhythm with median frequency of 72/min. At 3 month follow-up examination, ECG showed sinus rhythm.

      "A 57-year-old Caucasian male was brought to our emergency department (ED) following an allergic reaction (flushing, chest rash, and drop in blood pressure [BP] to 90/60 mm Hg) to intravenous (i.v.) amiodarone administered by the emergency medical service (EMS) to treat atrial fibrillation. Upon admission, he was anxious and complained of palpitations. He had a history of palpitations and experienced several episodes of irregular heart rhythm following lack of sleep, or periods of work-related stress.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) at the EMS showed AF with fast ventricular response (125 bpm). Blood pressure was 180/110 mm Hg and physical examination showed no abnormalities other than irregular heart rhythm on auscultation.

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 55-year-old male, with a history of chronic kidney disease for many years, received a living kidney transplant in 2013 and thereafter followed a regular immunosuppressive regimen, including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (0.5 g twice daily), tacrolimus (2 mg twice daily, the concentration was maintained at 4–5 ng/mL.), and methylprednisolone (5 mg once daily) (Fig. ). His creatinine levels were maintained at around 100 μmol/L most of the time, but increased to 180 μmol/L on Jan 15, 2020. He used to experience shortness of breath on exertion. He also had a history of heart failure, regularly taking oral medications, including clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) and aspirin (100 mg once daily), and occasionally taking furosemide (60 mg once daily).\n",
      "The patient presented to a local clinic in Wuhan on Jan 31, 2020, complaining of oliguria for two weeks. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral lung lesions, with a lot of speckle consolidation shadows seen in both lungs. An oropharyngeal swab from this patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2 as shown by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, suggesting that he suffered from pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. He displayed no fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea or vomiting at that time. He was then isolated in a makeshift hospital for further treatment.\n",
      "On Feb 8 (Day 0 of the illness, Day 0), the patient showed a mild cough without sputum, but developed dyspnea by Feb 12 (Day 4). He was then transferred to an intensive care unit in Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China), a site designated for treating severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients on Feb 13 (Day 5). On admission, he had a blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, a pulse of 104 beats per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 94% while breathing ambient air. His laboratory testing showed lymphocytopenia, hypercreatinemia, and increased levels of D-dimers, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cardiac troponin I (Table ). Moreover, his CT images showed bilateral lung interstitial disease, especially near the hilum, with ground-glass opacities (GGO) (Fig. a). A combined strategy was adopted to treat him, including cessation of tacrolimus and methylprednisolone, and initial supportive treatments (oxygen delivery via nasal cannula, furosemide therapy and injection of thymosin α1 and immunoglobulin) (Fig. ). Thymosin α1 is a peptide originally isolated from thymic tissue, and shown to regulate immune function in many diseases, such as sepsis and chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression []. The patient responded well to the therapy.\n",
      "On Feb 20 (Day 12), the patient showed improved clinical symptoms (BP 118/81 mm Hg, HR 84 bpm, RR 16 bpm; the patient displayed good consciousness and spirit and showed no obvious cough, expectoration, fever, chill, abdominal pain, or diarrhea; the patient had a measured SpO2 of 100% when receiving 4 L/min oxygen through a nasal cannula) and was transferred to a general ward. Due to incomplete improvement in imaging results, high levels of CRP (34.6 mg/L) and procalcitonin (0.14 ng/mL) (Table ), as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test on an oropharyngeal swab, the patient received anti-bacterial and anti-viral treatment with beta-methylcarbapenem (0.3 g twice daily) and oral lopinavir/ritonavir (1000 mg/d), respectively. During this anti-bacterial and anti-viral therapy period, methylprednisolone (20 mg once daily), gradually reduced MMF dosage, and an adjusted dosage of tacrolimus, were also re-introduced (Fig. ). While the patient subsequently showed improved clinical symptoms, his chest CT images on Feb 24 (Day 11) still showed extensive GGO (images not shown).\n",
      "To identify potential respiratory pathogens associated with the abnormal image findings, several laboratory tests were ordered. On Feb 25 (Day 17), his oropharyngeal swab remained positive for SARS-CoV-2. Microscopic analysis of his expectorated sputum (also Feb 25) did not detect P. jirovecii or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The result of his HIV test was negative. On Feb 28 (Day 20), his serum (1, 3)-beta-D glucan (BDG) level was 89.3 pg/mL, slightly above the normal range (< 70 pg/mL). He was suspected of carrying a fungal infection, especially PJP, based on the positive BDG test, his chest CT features and long immunosuppressive state. However, his impaired kidney function (with high creatinine level) at that time precluded empiric treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Instead, he was treated with micafungin (50 mg IV gtt once daily), an echinocandin that inhibits the synthesis of BDG []. Additionally, the anti-bacterial regimen with beta-methylcarbapenem was maintained empirically. Considering the possibility of lopinavir/ritonavir in increasing the concentration of tacrolimus in his blood, anti-viral treatment was replaced with umifenovir (0.2 g three times daily). After one week of micafungin treatment, serum BDG levels fell within the normal range (61.61 pg/mL). His clinical symptoms and laboratory findings continued to improve (Table ), with chest CT images on Mar 1 (Day 22) and Mar 8 (Day 29) showing gradual absorption of the ground-glass lesions (Fig. b and c). With his oropharyngeal swabs being SARS-CoV-2 negative on Mar 4 (Day 24) and 7 (Day 27), he was discharged on Mar 11 (Day 32). Since then, MMF was discontinued, but methylprednisolone (20 mg once daily) and tacrolimus (1 mg twice daily, the drug concentration was maintained at 2-3 ng/ml) were maintained. He remained well as of April 2 (Day 54), with lower serum creatinine level (112 μmol/L) (Table ) and moderately improved chest CT images (Fig. d).\n",
      "Given the incomplete absorption of the lesions in the lung but nearly normal serum creatinine level (112 μmol/L), we retrospectively analyzed the patient’s sputum collected on Feb 25 for the presence of P. jirovecii by a more sensitive method. Using a laboratory-developed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay that targets the mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA gene of P. jirovecii [], we found that the levels of P. jirovecii in his sputum were almost tenfold higher than those in a PJP positive sputum (collected from a non-COVID-19 patient). This finding suggested that the patient probably suffered from PJP. Accordingly, the patient received one month of anti-PJP treatment with TMP-SMX starting on April 4 (0.96 g twice daily), resulting in a favorable outcome, including significantly improved symptoms and imaging.\n",

      "A 16-year-old girl with a history of psoriasis presented to the emergency department for fever, cough and unintentional weight loss. Her symptoms began 4 months prior to presentation with intermittent, non-productive daytime cough associated with pleuritic chest pain. She describes daily tactile fevers and chills. She has also had intermittent diffuse, ‘crampy’ abdominal pain with associated non-bloody, non-bilious emesis occurring approximately three times per week. Additionally, she described nausea and anorexia, resulting in a 15 kg weight loss over the past 4 months. She denied upper respiratory symptoms, sore throat, dysphagia, haematemesis, haemoptysis, cyanosis, diarrhoea, melena, haematochezia, dysuria, haematuria or rashes. She denied syncope, presyncope or seizures. She reported her last menstrual period as 3 months prior and denied any current vaginal symptoms. She denied recent travel, known sick contacts, sexual activity or illicit and recreational drug use. She was born in Ethiopia, moved to the USA relatively soon after birth and last travelled there 9 years ago. She had no contact with recent international travellers or prisoners.\n",
      "She reported that during the past 4 months, she had been seen at an urgent care facility multiple times and treated with three different oral antibiotics for pneumonia; she cannot recall the names of these prescriptions. She has also been seen in an outpatient gastroenterology clinic and had an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy that demonstrated oesophageal candidiasis, for which she was treated with fluconazole. She was previously healthy with the exception of psoriasis. Regarding her psoriasis, she reported that she previously had diffuse skin involvement, but has never had arthritis. She was initially treated with adalimumab, a monoclonal antibody against tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, but was changed to methotrexate after being diagnosed with pneumonia. Her psoriatic symptoms are currently well controlled. She presented to the emergency department due to lack of improvement in systemic symptoms after the above management and a new sensation of a racing heartbeat.\n",
      "In the emergency department, her initial vital signs were: temperature 39.2°C, heart rate of 140 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, blood pressure of 115/61 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 94% on room air and weight 54.6 kg. On examination, she was tired and chronically ill-appearing, but non-toxic. Her physical examination was remarkable for tachycardia without murmur, bounding radial pulses and mild respiratory distress with asymmetrically (right>left) diminished basilar aeration. She does not have lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites or peripheral oedema. The remainder of her examination was normal. Laboratory studies were remarkable for normocytic anaemia, lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated prothrombin time and elevated inflammatory markers. Electrolytes, transaminases, thyroid profile and urine pregnancy test were normal. HIV antibody and viral load were negative. Review of records shows that her outside chest X-ray was remarkable for rounded opacities scattered throughout both lungs and a right upper lobe cavitary lesion.

      "A 16-year-old girl with a history of psoriasis presented to the emergency department for fever, cough and unintentional weight loss. Her symptoms began 4 months prior to presentation with intermittent, non-productive daytime cough associated with pleuritic chest pain. She describes daily tactile fevers and chills. She has also had intermittent diffuse, ‘crampy’ abdominal pain with associated non-bloody, non-bilious emesis occurring approximately three times per week. Additionally, she described nausea and anorexia, resulting in a 15 kg weight loss over the past 4 months. She denied upper respiratory symptoms, sore throat, dysphagia, haematemesis, haemoptysis, cyanosis, diarrhoea, melena, haematochezia, dysuria, haematuria or rashes. She denied syncope, presyncope or seizures. She reported her last menstrual period as 3 months prior and denied any current vaginal symptoms. She denied recent travel, known sick contacts, sexual activity or illicit and recreational drug use. She was born in Ethiopia, moved to the USA relatively soon after birth and last travelled there 9 years ago. She had no contact with recent international travellers or prisoners.\n",
      "She reported that during the past 4 months, she had been seen at an urgent care facility multiple times and treated with three different oral antibiotics for pneumonia; she cannot recall the names of these prescriptions. She has also been seen in an outpatient gastroenterology clinic and had an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy that demonstrated oesophageal candidiasis, for which she was treated with fluconazole. She was previously healthy with the exception of psoriasis. Regarding her psoriasis, she reported that she previously had diffuse skin involvement, but has never had arthritis. She was initially treated with adalimumab, a monoclonal antibody against tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, but was changed to methotrexate after being diagnosed with pneumonia. Her psoriatic symptoms are currently well controlled. She presented to the emergency department due to lack of improvement in systemic symptoms after the above management and a new sensation of a racing heartbeat.\n",
      "In the emergency department, her initial vital signs were: temperature 39.2°C, heart rate of 140 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, blood pressure of 115/61 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 94% on room air and weight 54.6 kg. On examination, she was tired and chronically ill-appearing, but non-toxic. Her physical examination was remarkable for tachycardia without murmur, bounding radial pulses and mild respiratory distress with asymmetrically (right>left) diminished basilar aeration. She does not have lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites or peripheral oedema. The remainder of her examination was normal. Laboratory studies were remarkable for normocytic anaemia, lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated prothrombin time and elevated inflammatory markers. Electrolytes, transaminases, thyroid profile and urine pregnancy test were normal. HIV antibody and viral load were negative. Review of records shows that her outside chest X-ray was remarkable for rounded opacities scattered throughout both lungs and a right upper lobe cavitary lesion. A chest CT was obtained, which reveals a cavitary right upper lobe mass ().\n",

      "A 45-year-old woman with a 3-year history of chronic anemia was followed up at the Gastroenterology outpatient department of another hospital, with a 6-month history of abdominal pain. The pain was intermittent, worse in the mornings, and localized to the epigastric region. The patient noticed that her abdomen became distended after meals and distension was relieved after a bowel movement. The patient noticed a 12-kg weight loss over the last 6 months. There was a history of nausea but no vomiting. The patient denied any history of loss of appetite, diarrhea or constipation, and upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding. There was no significant past medical history other than anemia and multiple blood transfusions. The patient denied any history of tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, drug abuse, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, chronic renal failure, peptic ulcer disease, and chronic pancreatitis. Her family history was unremarkable. The patient did not have any prior surgeries or history of malignancy. Workup for her chronic anemia included CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast, which revealed duodenal intussusception. The patient was booked for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in the referral hospital but missed her appointment and asked for a referral to another hospital.\n",
      "Upon arrival at our hospital, she appeared underweight (height, 162 cm; weight, 43 kg). Her vitals were stable, and she was afebrile (blood pressure, 118/67 mm/Hg; heart rate, 96 bpm; respiratory rate, 23 bpm; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; temperature: 36.9 °C). On examination, her abdomen was soft and laxative, with no tenderness, or organomegaly. A complete blood count on the day of admission revealed the following: low hemoglobin level, 7.2 g/dL (12.0–17.0 g/dL); mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 78.0 fL (80.0–100.0 fL); low hematocrit, 24.8% (40.0%–51.0%); leukocyte count, 8.2 × 109/L (4.5-11.0 × 109/L); and platelet count, 323 × 109/L (150-450 × 109/L). Other laboratory profiles were unremarkable. Contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed significant dilation of the stomach with no detectable gastric lesion. The third part of the duodenum was distended by a sausage-shaped intraluminal structure with alternating fat planes and dilated vessels reaching up to the first part of the duodenum, suggesting retrograde jejuno-duodenal intussusception. There was no detectable soft tissue lesion, and the rest of the bowel was unremarkable (A–C). Endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract revealed a large, long, mobile submucosal longitudinal and tortuous bulge extending from the first to the second part of the duodenum that moved freely with bowel contraction. The papilla of Vater was normal with no neoplastic process.\n",
      "The patient underwent laparoscopic exploration, which revealed antiperistaltic intussusception in the proximal jejunum (). A jejunostomy was performed, and the mass was pulled through in the proximal jejunum (A).\n",
      "A cholecystectomy was performed, and a pediatric feeding tube was passed through the cystic duct to locate the ampulla of Vater. The mass was not resectable without affecting the ampulla, so the decision was made to perform a pancreas-sparing duodenal resection. The excised duodenum with mass was sent for histopathological examination (B).\n",
      "Pathological findings showed a large polypoid mass with the mucosa pedunculated from the bowel lumen, measuring 12 × 7.5 × 2.0 cm3. Microscopic examination revealed a bowel mucosa with underlying submucosa showing lobules of benign normal-appearing Brunner's glands separated by fibrous stroma. The nodular proliferation of Brunner glands was accompanied by cystically dilated ducts and adipose tissue with no microscopic features of malignancy (A–C). The patient was discharged postoperatively in good condition, given an appointment after 1 month.\n",

The patient reported chronic methamphetamine use for 10 years, becoming an everyday user 3 years ago. He admitted to occasional polysubstance use that included ketamine, ecstasy, and alcohol, although those were limited to a few times a month. Past medical history was significant for two remote spontaneous pneumothoraces, but the patient stated that his current symptoms felt unrelated. Past surgical history was noncontributory and he denied allergies or taking any prescribed medications. Reviews of systems were positive for myalgias and fatigue.

      "A 73-year-old female patient, who was hospitalized since 3 months, presented with complaints of paroxysmal dry cough since 2 weeks. The patient was admitted initially due to progressive dyspnea. Respiratory distress occurred 2 days later and she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) after intubation for mechanical ventilation. Her past medical history included hypertension and diabetes mellitus for approximately 20 years; both of which were in a stable condition with regular medication. Six months before admission, she underwent a median sternotomy and thymectomy for thymoma. She denied having a recent travel history aboard but reported contact with a large pigeon population as there was a large dovecot near her residence. A series of examinations were performed for the unexplained respiratory failure, and myasthenic crisis was diagnosed based on high levels of acetylcholine receptor antibodies (> 4 nmol/L) and neurophysiological study findings. Consequently, she received several courses of plasma exchange followed by a high dose of prednisolone (30 mg daily) and azathioprine (25 mg daily) to treat the myasthenic crisis. Her respiratory condition improved after the therapy. She was transferred to the general ward after successfully weaning off mechanical ventilation. Oral prednisolone and azathioprine therapy was continued. After receiving prednisolone and azathioprine therapy for nearly 3 months, she developed dry cough. Physical examination revealed that respiratory rate was 15 breaths/min, blood pressure was 140/88 mmHg, heart rate was 80 beats/min, and body temperature was in the normal range. The remainder of the examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, and other organ systems was unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation included a peripheral white blood cell count of 8870/µL; hemoglobin, 10.8 g/dL; and platelet count of 299,000/µL. Her serum alanine aminotransferase level was 9 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase level was 19 U/L; blood urea nitrogen level was 13 mg/dL; creatinine level was 0.3 mg/dL; level of procalcitonin was 0.1 ng/Ml, and level of C-reactive protein was 1.78 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis (with the patient breathing ambient air) revealed pH 7.47, PaCO2 56.9 mmHg, PaO2 66.7 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 99%.\n",
      "A thoracic CT scan was performed. On comparing it with the previous thoracic CT scan performed on admission (Fig. a), a newly developed 2-cm consolidative nodule was observed on the upper lobe of the left lung (Fig. b). Serum aspergillus galactomannan antigen testing, fungus stain and fungus culture of sputum, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of sputum for mycobacterium tuberculosis were all negative. The CT-guided biopsy was performed, and its pathology revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells engulfing thick-wall micro-organisms (Fig. a). These organisms were 4–6 microns in diameter, stains bright red with Periodic Acid Schiff (Fig. b) and black in Gomori Methenamine-Silver (Fig. c), consistent with those of cryptococcus. A subsequent serum titer of cryptococcal antigen was 1:8 using Remel Cryptococcus Antigen Test Kit (Remel, Lenexa, KS, USA). Because there were no neurologic symptoms and signs indicated cryptococcus meningoencephalitis, lumbar puncture was not performed. Immune status of the patient was then assessed. Except for recent immunosuppressive therapy for the myasthenic crisis, the patient revealed no evidence of malignancy or vasculitis, and human immunodeficiency virus testing was negative. To determine the possibility of cross transmission from infected patients, we reviewed the incidence of cryptococcal infection cases in the ICU and the general ward for up to 1 month before the patient was diagnosed, but no new cryptococcal infection cases were reported. Intravenous fluconazole, 400 mg daily, was administered for pulmonary cryptococcal infection for 14 days. Respiratory symptoms nearly resolved after treatment and the patient was discharged for outpatient follow-up with continuation of oral fluconazole 400 mg daily. The chest CT scan, 3 months after discharge, revealed complete clearance of the lesion (Fig. c) and the relevant inflammatory biomarkers were in the normal range. No recurrence of the Cryptococcal infection has occurred to date.\n",

      "A 73-year-old female patient, who was hospitalized since 3 months, presented with complaints of paroxysmal dry cough since 2 weeks. The patient was admitted initially due to progressive dyspnea. Respiratory distress occurred 2 days later and she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) after intubation for mechanical ventilation. Her past medical history included hypertension and diabetes mellitus for approximately 20 years; both of which were in a stable condition with regular medication. Six months before admission, she underwent a median sternotomy and thymectomy for thymoma. She denied having a recent travel history aboard but reported contact with a large pigeon population as there was a large dovecot near her residence. A series of examinations were performed for the unexplained respiratory failure, and myasthenic crisis was diagnosed based on high levels of acetylcholine receptor antibodies (> 4 nmol/L) and neurophysiological study findings. Consequently, she received several courses of plasma exchange followed by a high dose of prednisolone (30 mg daily) and azathioprine (25 mg daily) to treat the myasthenic crisis. Her respiratory condition improved after the therapy. She was transferred to the general ward after successfully weaning off mechanical ventilation. Oral prednisolone and azathioprine therapy was continued. After receiving prednisolone and azathioprine therapy for nearly 3 months, she developed dry cough.

      "A 42-year-old female was seen in the emergency department with three days of severe abdominal pain and sepsis. Medical history included menometrorrhagia due to uterine fibroids and previous endometrial ablation in 2015. She used a contraceptive vaginal ring for three months prior and Provera for 2 days prior to presentation for persistent vaginal bleeding. Physical examination revealed the following vital signs: temperature 39.2°C; blood pressure 136/78 mmHg, pulse 132 beats/min, and respiratory rate 16 breaths/min. Oxygen saturation was 100% on room air. Physical exam revealed tenderness throughout the lower abdomen with voluntary guarding. Labarotory data revealed WBC of 12,000/µL, Hgb of 7.8 gm/dL and Hct of 25.7, sodium of 127 mmol/L, and chloride of 96 mmol/L. Lactate was normal at 1.5 mmol/L. Initial CT scan showed uterine masses, consistent with known fibroids, and minimal pelvic fluid ().\n",
      "She was initially admitted to the medical service for sepsis. Given her lower abdominal pain, Gynecology was consulted for presumed pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). She was started on empiric antibiotics for PID (ceftriaxone IV 1 g every 24 hours, azithromycin IV 500 mg every 24 hours, and metronidazole IV 500 mg every 8 hours). Blood, urine, and stool cultures were sent upon admission, all of which were negative.\n",
      "Her pain continued to progress with rising leukocytosis to 20,000/µL. A repeat CT scan on hospital day four showed interval development of ascites (). Surgical consultation was obtained, and she was found to have an acute abdomen. She was taken for a diagnostic laparoscopy, which revealed a dense fibrinous exudate and significant ascites in all four quadrants of the abdomen (). Multiple peritoneal biopsies were taken, and peritoneal fluid was sent for gram stain, cultures, and cytology.\n",
      "Postoperatively, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA-125 levels were obtained. CEA was within the normal range, and CA-125 was mildly elevated at 56.8 U/mL (normal 0–35.0 U/mL). Her WBC fluctuated between 15,000 and 25,000/µL. The peritoneal fluid gram stain did not reveal any bacteria. Cytology revealed rare mesothelial cells and abundant neutrophils but no malignant cells. Final pathology report stated the presence of benign fibromembranous tissue with severe acute inflammation and extensive necrosis, consistent with “severe necrotizing acute peritonitis.”\n",
      "Given the extensive inflammatory reaction, infectious disease was consulted. Group A Strep (GAS) peritonitis was suspected, and recommendations were made to continue ceftriaxone at 1 g IV every 24 hours in addition to one dose of clindamycin 600 mg IV. Azithromycin was added to ceftriaxone three days later (IV 500 mg every 24 hours). A streptolysin O antibody (ASO) titer was sent but came back normal at 61 I U/mL (normal range 0–330 IU/mL), arguing against GAS peritonitis. Ceftriaxone was stopped, and azithromycin was transitioned to oral 500 mg daily.\n",

      "A 75-year-old female presented to the emergency department with dyspnoea. She had been treated for recurrent lower respiratory tract infections by the general practitioner (GP) with oral antibiotics (12 cases in the past 14 months). Her relevant medical history included chronic kidney disease stage 3 (baseline creatinine 80–110 µmol/L), polymyalgia rheumatica requiring long-term steroids, asthma and chronic back pain. The pneumonia diagnosis was confirmed by a chest radiograph and CT showing multifocal nodular consolidation in the right lower lobe with cavitations and blood cultures were taken that grew Staphylococcus aureus.\n",
      "Her medical history otherwise included depression, hypercholesterolaemia, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, spondylosis, glaucoma, hypertension, lacunar stroke, transient ischaemic attack, vitamin B12 deficiency and vascular dementia.\n",
      "Her long-term treatment included hydromorphone, paracetamol, topiramate, paracetamol–codeine–doxylamine, doxylamine, colecalciferol, aspirin, duloxetine, pantoprazole, prednisolone, docusate, macrogol, hydroxocobalamin, salbutamol and denosumab.\n",
      "On presentation, she was initially afebrile, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 96%. On examination, there were crackles on the right base, dual heart sounds with no murmurs and no peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis. She was subsequently treated for pneumonia and urinary tract infection with intravenous piperacillin–tazobactam. The working diagnosis was S. aureus bacteraemia secondary to a pulmonary source.\n",
      "The patient was transferred to the closest tertiary hospital as the eventual need for further investigations, including a trans-oesophageal echo, was anticipated in the context of S. aureus bacteraemia. The treatment of her bacteraemia was eventually changed to intravenous flucloxacillin (2 g four times daily) once sensitivities were confirmed. Flucloxacillin was planned to continue for a further 5 weeks via peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) on an 8 g/24 hours infuser that was monitored via hospital in the home (HITH).\n",
      "Four weeks into the HITH treatment, the patient developed nausea and was investigated with blood results that showed worsening renal function associated with HAGMA. She was subsequently referred back to the regional hospital. Her heart rate was 105 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and O2 sat 98% on room air. At that point, HAGMA was attributed to an acute kidney injury (AKI). Following adequate fluid resuscitation, HAGMA and AKI persisted. She was investigated for the AKI with a renal ultrasound which was negative and there were no eosinophils found in the urine. Interstitial nephritis secondary to flucloxacillin use was considered as another reason for her AKI but was deemed unlikely. The treatment plan was to commence sodium bicarbonate 840 mg once daily following consultation with the renal team. Ultimately, further investigations for the AKI were completed at the tertiary hospital. The HAGMA was suspected to be caused by the concurrent use of flucloxacillin and paracetamol. As a result of this, flucloxacillin was changed to cefazolin and the patient transferred again to a tertiary facility pending further investigations as well as suspected pulmonary embolism following reports of chest pain.\n",

      "A 75-year-old female presented to the emergency department with dyspnoea. She had been treated for recurrent lower respiratory tract infections by the general practitioner (GP) with oral antibiotics (12 cases in the past 14 months). Her relevant medical history included chronic kidney disease stage 3 (baseline creatinine 80–110 µmol/L), polymyalgia rheumatica requiring long-term steroids, asthma and chronic back pain. The pneumonia diagnosis was confirmed by a chest radiograph and CT showing multifocal nodular consolidation in the right lower lobe with cavitations and blood cultures were taken that grew Staphylococcus aureus.\n",
      "Her medical history otherwise included depression, hypercholesterolaemia, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, spondylosis, glaucoma, hypertension, lacunar stroke, transient ischaemic attack, vitamin B12 deficiency and vascular dementia.\n",
      "Her long-term treatment included hydromorphone, paracetamol, topiramate, paracetamol–codeine–doxylamine, doxylamine, colecalciferol, aspirin, duloxetine, pantoprazole, prednisolone, docusate, macrogol, hydroxocobalamin, salbutamol and denosumab.\n",
      "On presentation, she was initially afebrile, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 96%. On examination, there were crackles on the right base, dual heart sounds with no murmurs and no peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis. She was subsequently treated for pneumonia and urinary tract infection with intravenous piperacillin–tazobactam. The working diagnosis was S. aureus bacteraemia secondary to a pulmonary source.\n",
      "The patient was transferred to the closest tertiary hospital as the eventual need for further investigations, including a trans-oesophageal echo, was anticipated in the context of S. aureus bacteraemia. The treatment of her bacteraemia was eventually changed to intravenous flucloxacillin (2 g four times daily) once sensitivities were confirmed. Flucloxacillin was planned to continue for a further 5 weeks via peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) on an 8 g/24 hours infuser that was monitored via hospital in the home (HITH).\n",
      "Four weeks into the HITH treatment, the patient developed nausea and was investigated with blood results that showed worsening renal function associated with HAGMA. She was subsequently referred back to the regional hospital. Her heart rate was 105 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and O2 sat 98% on room air. At that point, HAGMA was attributed to an acute kidney injury (AKI). Following adequate fluid resuscitation, HAGMA and AKI persisted.

      "A dyspneic 69-year-old male was referred for further management to our tertiary referral hospital with suspicion of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. He suffered typical chest pain, diaphoresis, and an anterior myocardial infarction 3 days before admission to our hospital and was treated with streptokinase in a general medical center. He also underwent dopamine and dobutamine therapy in that center because of a significant reduction in his blood pressure.\n",
      "On admission, he had a pulse rate of 105 bpm, a blood pressure of 80/65 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 25 (O2 saturation = 92%). On physical examination, he had muffled heart sounds and a fine crackle in the lower two-thirds of both lungs. His jugular venous pressure was higher than normal, and his electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with significant Q waves in V1 through V6 precordial leads.\n",
      "Initial transthoracic echocardiography showed a severe abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF = 20%) with a massive pericardial effusion with hemodynamic effect (right ventricular outflow tract collapse). The results were highly suggestive for rupture of the apical septal myocardium with clot formation.\n",
      "The operation was performed through a standard median sternotomy. The proximal part of pericardium was partially opened, and a controlled amount of blood was removed gradually, which immediately improved his hemodynamic indices. Standard cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was performed with mild hypothermia (32°C) and standard cardioplegic myocardial preservation. The heart was arrested, and the pericardium was opened completely. Thereafter, the remaining blood was drained. A large myocardial infarction in the apex was seen, and the sub-epicardial hematoma extended to the lateral side of left and right ventricular free wall. This resulted in intramural perforation of the apex (). The distal part of the LAD was inside the hematoma and was not suitable for graft anastomosis. Under dry conditions, a 95 × 48 mm piece of TachoSil® patch was positioned on the area and was pressed to the surface of the ventricle for 5 minutes. This was repeated two times after which no bleeding was observed. Thereafter, a large autologous pericardial patch was fixed over the surface covered by TachoSil® fleece far from fragile necrotic tissue with a few separate 6 - 0 Prolene sutures to obtain maximal adhesion to the epicardial surface. Finally, a generous Teflon felt patch was sewn over all previous patches to reinforce adhesion and avoid blood oozing (). The aortic cross-clamp was released, and the patient was weaned from CPB after normothermia with normal sinus rhythm, epinephrine, and insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump. The CPB and aortic cross-clamp times were 112 and 47 minutes, respectively. No bleeding occurred during the follow-up period.\n",
      "The patient was alive and had a good clinical status 12 months later. Postoperative and follow-up transesophageal echocardiography showed normal left and right ventricular size (LVEF of 30% - 35%) without pseudo-aneurysm. All apical, inferoseptal, and anteroseptal segments showed akinesia. Echocardiography also revealed anterior hypokinesia. There was no ventricular septal defect.

      "A previously healthy 50-year-old intoxicated man was driving on a road on a May afternoon when he attempted to move a snake off the road with a stick to prevent it from being run over. He was bitten on the dorsum of his right hand by a positively identified 6-foot long diamondback rattlesnake (). He immediately called his wife who called emergency medical services (EMS) while he drove home. When EMS arrived, he was found to be confused, nauseated, and vomiting, with altered mental status and intermittent combativeness. Once in the transport vehicle, an intravenous line was established and he was given 25 mg of intravenous (IV) diphenhydramine.\n",
      "Upon arrival in the emergency department (ED) less than one hour after the initial injury, the patient was noted to be tachycardic (HR 131), hypotensive (92/79), and stridorous. On physical examination, he had decreased mental status, voice change, and significant perioral, pharyngeal, and marked glossal edema. Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) was initiated due to impending complete upper airway obstruction. The patient was pretreated with 100 mcg of phenylephrine IV to prevent hemodynamic decompensation during RSI. During video-assisted laryngoscopy, pronounced epiglottal and cord edema was noticed, and multiple attempts of passing a styletted endotracheal tube and gum elastic bougie failed. Bag valve mask ventilation was difficult despite use of an oral airway with a decline in his oxygen saturation to 78%. Thus the decision was made to proceed with emergency cricothyrotomy using a bougie-assisted landmark-guided technique, which was successful on its first attempt. A cuffed 6-0 endotracheal tube was passed over the bougie, with good chest rise and end-tidal capnography. At the time of securing the airway, the patient's oxygen saturation had returned to 100% secondary to continued uninterrupted two-person oral airway assisted bag valve mask ventilation.\n",
      "Initial arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.03, pCO2 of 56.1 mmHg, and pO2 of 174.0 mmHg on 60% FiO2. He received 125 mg IV methylprednisolone and 1 L Plasma-Lyte A with improvement of his blood pressure to 119/76.\n",
      "His right upper extremity was noted to have fang marks 2.5 cm apart in the first dorsal webspace (). There was severe amount of edema over the palmar and dorsal surface of the right hand extending proximally to the wrist with mottling and ecchymoses of the right hand. The compartments remained compressible, capillary refill remained brisk, and oxygen saturation remained 95–99% SpO2 in all five fingers. Orthopedic surgery was consulted by the emergency physicians for the evaluation of progressive swelling and potential compartment syndrome; no surgical intervention was performed as the patient maintained a radial pulse by Doppler signal and brisk capillary refill.\n",
      "The state's poison center was simultaneously consulted in the ED; an initial bolus of 6 vials of FabAV (CroFab) was administered. Initial pre-FabAV laboratory findings from the emergency department demonstrated consumptive coagulopathy: thrombocytopenia (platelets 20 × 103 mm−3), d-dimer > 20 μg mL−1, fibrinogen < 35 mg dL−1, INR > 8, PTT > 240 sec, and PT > 150 sec. The patient was subsequently admitted to the medical intensive care unit for further management.\n",

      "A previously healthy 75-yr-old Korean woman was hospitalized with a 7-day history of exertional dyspnea and fever on August 16, 2011. She had not raised any pet dogs or cats. On admission, her vital signs showed body temperature 38.3℃, blood pressure 147/63 mmHg, heart rate 86/min, and respiratory rate 18/min. On physical examination, a grade 3 diastolic heart murmur was detected at left upper sternal border. Her complete blood count showed WBC 7,910/µL (neutrophils 90.8%, lymphocytes 7.5%), hemoglobin 12.7 g/dL and platelet 71,000/µL. Chemistry profiles showed total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, AST 16 IU/L, ALT 4 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 79 IU/L, total protein 6.1 g/dL and albumin 2.8 g/dL. BUN 17.1 mg/dL, creatinine 0.87 mg/dL and CRP 1.4 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.537, pO2 65.9 mmHg, pCO2 31.3 mmHg, O2 saturation 92.2%, and HCO3 26 mM. Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria and microalbuminuria. A chest radiograph and electrocardiogram showed no abnormality. Echocardiography demonstrated the presence of oscillating vegetation (0.46 × 1.77 cm) attached to the aortic valve, as well as moderate aortic regurgitation. Ceftriaxone was empirically given in a dose of 2 g/day after repeated blood cultures. On hospital day 2, she underwent urgent valve replacement surgery due to the risk of embolization. Intraoperative findings revealed 0.5 × 1.5 cm sized oscillating mass on left coronary cusp. Blood cultures obtained prior to antibiotic administration were all negative. Microbiological examination of the excised aortic valve and vegetation revealed no organism on the Gram stain and the culture grew no organism. Histology revealed fibromyxoid valvulopathy and chronic active inflammation with vegetation, which were consistent with infective endocarditis. Empirical ceftriaxone treatment was continued under the diagnosis of culture-negative endocarditis.\n",
      "Bacterial DNA was extracted from surgically excised valve tissue and vegetation, directly. A 16S rRNA fragment was amplified with the universal primers 4F (5'-TTGGAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCT-3'), 534R (5'-TACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-3'), 27F (5'-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3'), and 801R (5'-GGCGTGGACTTCCAGGGTATCT-3').\n",
      "The 16S rRNA gene sequence showed 100% (707/707) similarity to that of the Bartonella quintana strain (accession no. BX897700 and AJ250247) in the GenBank database (). The next closest sequences were those of Bartonella henselae, and it showed 98.7% (699/708) similarity (accession no. DQ645426 and BX897699). Identification to the Bartonella species can be accepted if there is a ≥ 99% match with the 16S rRNA gene sequence and a difference of greater than 0.8% between those of other different species, according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline MM18-A (). B. quintana was also only the best-matched strain in the BIBI database (). Based on the molecular identification using GenBank and BIBI databases, we concluded that B. quintana was the best matched species.\n",
      "In addition, serologic testing with the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) method, which was performed at the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed an IgG titer of 1:512 to Bartonella spp. After she was finally diagnosed with B. quintana endocarditis, gentamicin was added to ceftriaxone in a dose of 1.7 mg/kg q8h.

      "The patient was a 32-year-old female, mother of a 13-month-old boy who was directly breastfed since birth with complementary food added at 6 months of age. On January 20, 2020, the patient and her son had a family meal with relatives who returned to Yiwu from Wuhan for the Spring Festival. Two weeks later the patient had nasal congestion, and her son had a fever with a peak temperature of 38.4 °C, dry cough, and nasal congestion. Two days after the onset (February 2, 2020), tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid performed at the Fourth Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, were positive in both the mother and the son, whereas the patient’s husband had a negative result. The results were confirmed by the Yiwu Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The patient suffered from postpartum depression, felt deeply anxious, and insisted on staying with her child. At the same time, the husband asked to accompany his wife and son due to concerns about the patient’s mental health. To respect the wish of the patient and her family, and after consultation with psychiatrists, the family was treated in the same negative-pressure isolation ward room.\n",
      "On admission, the mother had nasal congestion, but no rhinorrhea, cough, sputum, fever, or fatigue. The physical examination revealed a body temperature of 36.4 °C, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, a pulse of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 102/74 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% while breathing ambient air. Lung auscultation indicated no abnormalities. The results of a routine blood tests (complete blood count, liver and renal function), C-reactive protein and chest Xray were normal. Respiratory virus antigen quadruplet test (Influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus) and the nucleic acid test for Influenza A and B virus were negative. The patient received atomized inhalation of recombinant human interferon α-2b 5 million International Unit (IU) in 2 mL sterilized water twice a day as the antiviral treatment from hospital day one to day 28 and traditional Chinese medicine as a supplemental therapy from hospital day four to day 28. She continued directly breastfeeding four to five times every day. The symptom of nasal congestion improved on hospital day 2, and white blood cell count declined to 2.7 × 109/L, while the lymphocyte count was 0.9 × 109/L. The nasopharyngeal swab specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but the serum was negative. On hospital day 3, the symptoms of nasal congestion disappeared, not to return. The mother’s body temperature and oxygen saturation without oxygen inhalation were monitored and remained within the normal range, and the patient was in stable condition. On hospital day 4, the plain chest CT scan indicated the presence of density-increased patchy consolidation and ground-glass shadow in the lower lobe of the right lung, and viral pneumonia was the likely diagnosis (Fig. a). Subsequently, on hospital day 10, white blood cell and lymphocyte counts returned to a normal level, and liver and renal function and myocardial enzyme tests continued to be normal. During the period of hospitalization, the mother’s serum, milk and feces specimens tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but the nasopharyngeal swabs were repeatedly positive. Chest CT scans on hospital days 10 and 23 showed the gradual clearing of the lungs. (Fig. b, c). On hospital days 9 and 25 after admission, the breastmilk tests yielded a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and negative for IgM. Similarly, the maternal serum was positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and negative for IgM on hospital days 16 and 20. On hospital day 28, the patient was discharged as three consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for SARS- CoV-2 nucleic acid. The major laboratory results of the patient are listed in Table .\n",
      "The patient’s 13-month-old son had a fever, occasional dry cough, and nasal congestion at admission to the hospital. The physical examination revealed a body temperature of 37.6 °C, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, a pulse of 105 beats per minute, blood pressure of 95/56 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 99% while breathing ambient air, and bodyweight of 10 kg. There was no abnormality in lung auscultation. During the hospitalization, antiviral treatment with atomized inhalation of recombinant human interferon α-2b 1.5 million International Unit (IU) in 2 mL sterilized water was performed twice a day for 8 days, from day 1 to day 8 of hospitalization. On the day of admission, the white blood cell count was low at 3.7 × 109/L, and lymphocyte count was 2 × 109/L. The infant’s serum tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. On hospital day 2, the temperature returned to the normal value, and remained normal thereafter, but occasional dry cough and runny nose continued. On hospital day 4, feces and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, and plain chest CT scan revealed ground-glass shadows in the lower lobe of the right lung (Fig. a). On hospital day 6, the child’s cough was essentially resolved, while occasional rhinorrhea persisted. At that time, the counts of white blood cells and lymphocytes were 6.9 × 109/L and 5.1 × 109/L, respectively. The child became free of symptoms on hospital day 7. On hospital day 14, the serum was negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. Nasopharyngeal swabs and feces specimens repeatedly tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. On hospital day 28, when the child tested negatively two consecutive times for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swabs and chest CT indicated that the ground-glass shadows in the lungs were essentially absorbed (Fig. b), the child was discharged. The major laboratory results of the child are listed in Table .\n",

Lung auscultation indicated no abnormalities. The results of a routine blood tests (complete blood count, liver and renal function), C-reactive protein and chest Xray were normal. Respiratory virus antigen quadruplet test (Influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus) and the nucleic acid test for Influenza A and B virus were negative. The patient received atomized inhalation of recombinant human interferon α-2b 5 million International Unit (IU) in 2 mL sterilized water twice a day as the antiviral treatment from hospital day one to day 28 and traditional Chinese medicine as a supplemental therapy from hospital day four to day 28. She continued directly breastfeeding four to five times every day. The symptom of nasal congestion improved on hospital day 2, and white blood cell count declined to 2.7 × 109/L, while the lymphocyte count was 0.9 × 109/L. The nasopharyngeal swab specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but the serum was negative. On hospital day 3, the symptoms of nasal congestion disappeared, not to return. The mother’s body temperature and oxygen saturation without oxygen inhalation were monitored and remained within the normal range, and the patient was in stable condition. On hospital day 4, the plain chest CT scan indicated the presence of density-increased patchy consolidation and ground-glass shadow in the lower lobe of the right lung, and viral pneumonia was the likely diagnosis (Fig. a). Subsequently, on hospital day 10, white blood cell and lymphocyte counts returned to a normal level, and liver and renal function and myocardial enzyme tests continued to be normal. During the period of hospitalization, the mother’s serum, milk and feces specimens tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but the nasopharyngeal swabs were repeatedly positive. Chest CT scans on hospital days 10 and 23 showed the gradual clearing of the lungs. (Fig. b, c). On hospital days 9 and 25 after admission, the breastmilk tests yielded a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and negative for IgM. Similarly, the maternal serum was positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and negative for IgM on hospital days 16 and 20. On hospital day 28, the patient was discharged as three consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for SARS- CoV-2 nucleic acid. The major laboratory results of the patient are listed in Table .\n",
      "The patient’s 13-month-old son had a fever, occasional dry cough, and nasal congestion at admission to the hospital. The physical examination revealed a body temperature of 37.6 °C, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, a pulse of 105 beats per minute, blood pressure of 95/56 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 99% while breathing ambient air, and bodyweight of 10 kg. There was no abnormality in lung auscultation. During the hospitalization, antiviral treatment with atomized inhalation of recombinant human interferon α-2b 1.5 million International Unit (IU) in 2 mL sterilized water was performed twice a day for 8 days, from day 1 to day 8 of hospitalization. On the day of admission, the white blood cell count was low at 3.7 × 109/L, and lymphocyte count was 2 × 109/L. The infant’s serum tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. On hospital day 2, the temperature returned to the normal value, and remained normal thereafter, but occasional dry cough and runny nose continued. On hospital day 4, feces and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, and plain chest CT scan revealed ground-glass shadows in the lower lobe of the right lung (Fig. a). On hospital day 6, the child’s cough was essentially resolved, while occasional rhinorrhea persisted. At that time, the counts of white blood cells and lymphocytes were 6.9 × 109/L and 5.1 × 109/L, respectively. The child became free of symptoms on hospital day 7. On hospital day 14, the serum was negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. Nasopharyngeal swabs and feces specimens repeatedly tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. On hospital day 28, when the child tested negatively two consecutive times for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swabs and chest CT indicated that the ground-glass shadows in the lungs were essentially absorbed (Fig. b), the child was discharged. The major laboratory results of the child are listed in Table .\n",

      "A 71-year-old African American male presented for routine follow-up with his primary care physician 3 months after initiating atorvastatin 80 mg and pioglitazone 15 mg daily. His lipid panel revealed a total cholesterol of 152 mg/dL, triglycerides of 83 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 59 mg/dL, and a calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) of 76 mg/dL. LFTs were notable for an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 1093 U/L (upper limit of normal [ULN] 41 U/L), an alanine transaminase (ALT) of 1385 U/L (ULN 58 U/L), and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 265 U/L (ULN 129 U/L; R Factor 11.6; ). Total bilirubin was elevated to 1.5 mg/dL (ULN 1.2 mg/dL). The patient denied myalgias, pruritus, or abdominal pain. He was admitted for further management.\n",
      "The patient denied known hypotensive episodes or recent use of alcohol, herbal supplements, antibiotics, or acetaminophen. Gamma glutamyl-transferase was elevated to 551 U/L (ULN 50 U/L). Serum acetaminophen and ethanol were undetectable. Hepatitis A virus IgM/IgG, hepatitis B virus core IgM/IgG, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) antibodies were negative, as were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HIV-1 and HCV RNA. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic, anti-mitochondrial, and liver-kidney microsome antibodies were not detected. Serum IgG, copper, and ceruloplasmin levels were normal. Remaining workup was unrevealing except for a borderline-positive smooth muscle antibody titer of 1:20 (normal <1:20) and a ferritin of 1469 ng/mL (ULN 336 ng/mL). Serum albumin (3.4 g/dL) and prothrombin time international normalized ratio (1.01) were within normal limits. Liver ultrasound revealed “mildly increased echogenicity, coarsened echotexture, and attenuation of sound beam” suggestive of “hepatic steatosis and/or diffuse hepatocellular disease.” The right lobe measured 14.1 cm. A prior abdominal computerized tomography scan with contrast at age 60 years revealed only a punctate calcification, likely a granuloma, within the right lobe.\n",
      "On admission, his temperature was 36.8 °C, heart rate was 67 beats per minute, blood pressure was 123/63 mm Hg, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. Physical examination revealed no scleral icterus, a soft and nontender abdomen without palpable masses or organomegaly, and normal mental status. Atorvastatin and pioglitazone were discontinued on admission with rapid improvement in LFTs (see ). Liver biopsy was therefore not performed. The patient remained asymptomatic and was discharged on hospital day 4 with normalization of LFTs within 1 month. Simvastatin 20 mg daily and pioglitazone 15 mg daily were started 3 and 10 months after discharge, respectively. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen at 3 months again showed a likely granuloma but no steatosis. Serum LFTs have since remained within normal limits.\n",
      "Before starting atorvastatin, the patient had been taking simvastatin 40 mg daily for 11 years for an elevated LDL-c of 137 mg/dL and a 10-year ASCVD risk of 18.9%. Other pertinent medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and stage 2 chronic kidney disease. He had no history of ASCVD. His baseline serum LFTs were within normal limits. No change in LFTs or other side effects were noted while on simvastatin. His LDL-c reached a nadir of 74 mg/dL at age 70 years.\n",
      "Three months prior to this presentation, the patient’s LDL-c was elevated to 93 mg/dL, at which point simvastatin was stopped and atorvastatin 80 mg daily was started. A goal LDL-c below 70 mg/dL was targeted for secondary prevention out of concern for prior ischemic stroke resulting in bilateral superior altitudinal hemianopsia noted on visual field testing 6 months prior. Pioglitazone 15 mg daily was started simultaneously with atorvastatin for an elevated hemoglobin A1c of 8.1%. He was continued on his other medications, including gabapentin 300 mg 3 times daily for diabetic neuropathy, glipizide 20 mg twice daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, metformin 1000 mg twice daily, omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, paroxetine 20 mg daily, and trazodone 100 mg as needed.

The symptoms were repeated after routine symptomatic treatment. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan taken in January 2018 had showed that his right lung was spotted by small piece of shadow, accompanied by a cavity. The patient refused to initiate antitubercular therapy. The symptoms were improved after self-administration of cephalosporin as anti-infection treatment for 1 week. In May, the cough and sputum were aggravated, accompanied by fever in the afternoon, with body temperature around 38 °C. In the beginning of July, chest CT showed that the patchy shadow was scattered in two lungs with multiple cavities. The large consolidation in the right upper lung was significantly progressed compared with half a year ago. Considering combination of pulmonary tuberculosis and pulmonary infection, he was hospitalized.\n",
      "At admission, physical examination revealed the following: weight 53 kg; BMI 16.7, body temperature 38.7 °C, pulse 85/min, blood pressure 118/72 mmHg, finger oxygen saturation degree (FOSD) 98%. The lungs had lower breath sounds, with no obvious dry or wet rale. The auxiliary examination showed that the following test items were normal, including blood routine, biochemistry, coagulation, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, arterial blood gas analysis and echocardiography. D-dimer was 13.17 mg/L. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. The details of chest CT was shown in Fig. . Acid-fast bacilli staining test for sputum sample was positive (4+/3+), which confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.\n",
      "Routine anti-tuberculosis regimen was initiated, including isoniazid (300 mg/day), rifampin (450 mg/day), pyrazinamide (1500 mg/day) and ethambutol (750 mg/day). After 3 days of treatment, the body temperature dropped down to the normal, and the cough was relieved. Respiratory symptoms were also improved after 15 days of treatment. At that time, the patient suddenly felt chest tightness, chest pain, and shortness of breath after increased activity (three times more than the usual). Physical examination revealed: heart beats 138/m, blood pressure 88/58 mmHg, FOSD 86%. Even after 6 L high-flow oxygen intake, FOSD was maintained at 90%. Arterial blood gas analysis without oxygen inhalation indicated: pH 7.44, PO2 48 mmHg, PCO2 33 mmHg, SPO2 86%, Oxygenation Index 228.57 mmHg, D-dimer 14.03 mg/L. Electrocardiogram showed atrial tachycardia, non-specific ST elevation. Taking together, all the data highly suggested PTE. Emergency computer tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) inspection showed signs of filling defects in the trunk and branches of the left pulmonary artery and the right lower pulmonary artery (Fig. ).\n",
      "According to the CTPA result, the patient was diagnosed as a large-scale PTE, and the risk stratification was medium-high. The patient was prescribed with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (0.1 mL/10 kg) for anticoagulation. Then, under pulmonary angiography, a combined thrombolytic therapy including mechanical thrombolysis, aspiration, and topical urokinase (300,000 U) was applied to the left pulmonary artery. Fortunately, as shown in Fig. , the filling defect of left pulmonary artery disappeared. After the interventional therapy, the patient received intravenous pumping of 20,000 U urokinase every 1 h for 24 h. The symptoms of chest tightness, chest pain and shortness of breath were significantly improved, while the blood oxygen saturation and blood pressure returned to normal, and the vital signs were stable. Neither hemoptysis nor gastrointestinal bleeding occurred during the period of thrombolysis. The deep vein B-ultrasound of double lower limbs was performed and found a flocculent echo in the superior cavity of the upper right femoral vein, and extended into the external iliac vein. Then protein C, protein S activity, coagulation factor V leiden mutation, prothrombin 20210A, lupus anticoagulant, homocysteine, were determined and no abnormality was found. Anti-tuberculosis and warfarin anticoagulant therapy were continued, and international normalized ratio (INR) value was monitored and adjusted between 2 and 3. The patient was discharged with self-administration of oral anti-TB drugs and anticoagulant drug. At follow-up after 20 days of discharge, B-ultrasound showed that the deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of right lower extremity of the patient disappeared. At follow-up of 4 months, the patient was re-examined with chest enhanced CT in the outpatient department of our hospital and no obvious emboli was found.\n",

      "A 28-year-old man was admitted in our hospital on Jul 13, 2018 because of recurrent cough and yellow-phlegm accompanied by fever for more than 10 months. The symptoms were repeated after routine symptomatic treatment. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan taken in January 2018 had showed that his right lung was spotted by small piece of shadow, accompanied by a cavity. The patient refused to initiate antitubercular therapy. The symptoms were improved after self-administration of cephalosporin as anti-infection treatment for 1 week. In May, the cough and sputum were aggravated, accompanied by fever in the afternoon, with body temperature around 38 °C. In the beginning of July, chest CT showed that the patchy shadow was scattered in two lungs with multiple cavities.

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 35-year-old female presented to the emergency department via ambulance with a chief complaint of chest pain and dyspnea for two hours, described as constant in nature and sudden in onset. She could identify no precipitating events and was resting in bed when it started. The patient complained of severe pain in the back of her neck and left arm, which worsened with inhalation. She found nothing to relieve the symptoms and denied fever, chills, productive cough, leg pain, and lower extremity swelling.\n",
      "Her medical history included coronary artery disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, deep vein thrombosis, dyslipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux, headaches, and hypertension. Her surgical history was significant for three-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. Her medications and allergies were reviewed but not pertinent. The patient used caffeine daily and denied having ever used alcohol or recreational drugs. She reported on her last primary care visit to be a former smoker. Initial examination revealed tachycardia at 126 beats per minute, 18 labored respirations per minute, temperature of 98°F and blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, and was 97% on 2 liters (L) of oxygen. Emergency medical services initiated their chest pain protocol as well as oxygen but did not obtain room air saturation. The patient was noted to be awake, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time, with an anxious affect. Head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat exam was unremarkable. Respiratory exam showed increased work of breathing with moderate distress, but no adventitious lung sounds. Cardiac auscultation revealed a regular rhythm, without murmur, rub, or gallop. Abdominal exam was notable for obesity but non-tender. Lower extremity exam revealed no edema or calf pain.\n",
      "The patient was treated with aspirin, hydromorphone, ondansetron, diphenhydramine for itching, 2L per minute oxygen via nasal cannula, and 1L of normal saline bolus followed by 100 ml/hr continuous infusion. She was placed in the clinical decision unit and an extensive investigation was undertaken. Acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary emboli, and pneumonia led the differential diagnoses. The patient received a repeat dose of hydromorphone due to sustained pain. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia normal axis and nonspecific t-wave changes similar to prior. She was found to have an unchanged chest radiograph compared to two years prior with hyperlucent lungs, sternotomy wires, and vascular clips. Specifically, no pneumothorax, consolidations, vascular redistribution patterns, or pleural fluid were identified. She had a normal complete blood count, procalcitonin, creatine kinase, and troponin. A measured glucose of 667 mg/dL with pseudohyponatremia 128mmol/L, chloride of 96 mmol/L, and her D-Dimer was noted to be slightly elevated. She received eight units of subcutaneous insulin and a second liter of normal saline.\n",
      "A computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest was ordered to rule out pulmonary emboli. Before receiving the CT, the patient experienced a brief oxygen desaturation to 83% and was subsequently placed on a 5L per minute high-flow oxygen mask. During the CT, she was slightly confused and refused to lie flat. She then experienced several episodes of desaturation and at that point was requiring 12L per minute on a high-flow oxygen mask to maintain 90% saturation by pulse oximetry. After completing the CT, the patient had an arterial blood gas performed to clarify the extent of her hypoxia. Her pH was 7.42, PaCO2 36 mmHg, PaO2 50 mmHg, and HCO3 23 mEq/L. methemoglobin was 0.4% and carboxyhemoglobin was 1.1%. Arterial lactate was 2.4 mmol/L. Biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) support was initiated in an attempt to supplement the patient’s respiratory efforts and prevent intubation.\n",
      "The CT was reported with nodular infiltrates centered in the lower lung zones () with some confluence at the lung bases not previously seen on chest radiograph. Mediastinal adenopathy not previously seen on CT from two years prior and a nodular thickening of the hila were also noted. In addition, there was a 1.5 × 1.5 cm collection of hypodense fluid and loss of distinction in the cortex of the right kidney suggestive of trauma.\n",
      "A broader history was elicited from the patient and husband to discern a possible infectious or inflammatory etiology of the observed lower respiratory pneumonitis/inhalational injury pattern. The patient and her spouse denied trauma, fever, “huffing” paint, methamphetamine use or production, bonfires, and open fires at home. The husband interjected with commentary on the patient’s heavy use of ENDS. The patient admitted to daily use of two refill containers she knew to be 2.5%/ml or 25mg/ml in nicotine concentration, which she believed was equal to a pack of cigarettes. The husband was unable to identify the single refill product that was the most recently used at home, and the patient had three different ENDS.\n",
      "The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and upon arrival she was noted to have extensive rales, with notable work of breathing that caused truncated speech. The patient tolerated the BIPAP well, but became increasingly dyspneic despite pressure support from the BIPAP. Her increased work of breathing and impending respiratory failure urged endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. A bronchoscopy was performed that demonstrated erythema of the tracheal tissues extending to the carina that appeared cobblestoned and/or leathery. The main bronchi had a yellow, vesicular appearance with interspersed erythema and increased friability of the tissue. The right mainstem bronchus and remaining airways had a rust-colored appearance along with erythema extending into the visible lower airways (). The pattern was postulated to be inhalational injury by pulmonary medicine.\n",
      "Upon ICU admission the patient was treated empirically for bacterial pneumonia with meropenem levofloxacin and vancomycin. The right lower lobe bronchial alveolar lavage culture resulted in heavy growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureas (MRSA) 48 hours after admission. Her urine culture was positive for Escherichia coli.\n",
      "The patient continued to decline over the next 48 hours. She was transferred to a tertiary care center for possible ECMO, burn expertise, and continued intensive care.\n",
      "Upon arrival to the tertiary care center, she was persistently hypoxemic and failed a trial of mechanical ventilation with inhaled epoprostenol. Repeat bronchoscopy was performed showing persistent vesicular injury pattern (). She underwent emergent placement of veno-venous ECMO. She was stabilized and subsequent examinations showed a left hemiparesis. The neurologic insult was diffuse on magnetic resonance imaging and read as hypoxic, toxic and or metabolic insult. She improved on ECMO, eventually receiving a tracheostomy, which was decannulated 14 days later. She was returned to the long-term rehabilitation unit at the initial treatment center.

      "A 25-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with nonresolving pneumonia. The patient had felt well until two weeks before her admission, when she began to experience a dry cough, dyspnea and pleuritic pain. Her respiratory symptoms did not respond to a 5-day course of oral cephalosporin, and macrolide antibiotics had been prescribed before her admission. She was a non-smoker with unremarkable past medical history.\n",
      "On admission the body temperature was 36.6℃, the heart rate was 84/min, the respiration rate was 20/minute and the blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg. On physical examination, the patient was alert and not in great discomfort. There was a crackle sound over the left lower lung zone. There was no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Detailed examination of the cardiovascular system and abdomen was unremarkable. Chest radiography disclosed a pneumonic infiltration on the left lower lung field and there was no cardiomegaly (). Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the chest revealed a consolidation with air-bronchogram in the left lower lobe and a small amount of pleural effusion (). The complete blood count showed a normal white cell count (8.4×109/L). There was no hypoxemia on the blood gas analysis (pH 7.4, PaCO2 37.2 mmHg, SaO2 98%) when she was breathing room air. The other laboratory investigations showed normal electrolytes and renal and liver function tests. The fasting glucose was normal. The serum anti-HIV antibody was negative. The serum immunoglobulin levels (including IgG, IgA and IgM) were normal. Pulmonary function testing showed a mild restrictive pattern (the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) was 2.50/2.32L; the ratio was 93%), and there was a normal diffusion coefficient for carbon monoxide (DLco: 109%). The initial examination of the sputum for acid-fast bacilli with gram staining and culture did not reveal any organisms. The blood culture was sterile after 7 days incubation. We then conducted a bronchoscopic examination. There were no endobronchial abnormalities. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed the lymphodominant nature (a lymphocyte count of 70%, the macrophages were 28%). The BAL fluid culture was negative and there were neither acid-fast bacilli nor any pathogens.\n",
      "During the first six days of this patient's admission to our hospital, her annoying respiratory symptoms and lung consolidation did not improved for all the combination antibiotic treatment (intravenous cefuroxime and oral clarithromycin). We performed a subsequent computed tomography guided percutaneous needle biopsy on the sixth hospital day. The tissue pathology revealed granulomatous lesion including multinucleated giant cells and fungal spores. The specimens were stained with Hematoxilin-Eosin, mucicarmine, Gomori-Methenamine silver (GMS), and periodic-acid-Schiff (PAS). The Hematoxilin-Eosin and GMS stain showed granulomatous inflammation with numerous yeast-like organisms that were surrounded by clear halos, and these organisms were present within multinucleated giant cells and in the intercellular spaces (). Mucicarmine staining for capsular material was negative. With performing additional Fontana-Masson silver staining (FMS), the black color in the walls of the organism was disclosed (). This special stain pattern is a characteristic of C. neoformans, and especially for the capsule deficient form. Subsequently, the antibiotic regimen was replaced by 1-week of once-a-day intravenous fluconazole treatment and the patient was discharged on oral fluconazole. Further cultures of the lung specimen yielded moderate growth of Cryptococcus neoformans afterward.

      "A 25-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with nonresolving pneumonia. The patient had felt well until two weeks before her admission, when she began to experience a dry cough, dyspnea and pleuritic pain. Her respiratory symptoms did not respond to a 5-day course of oral cephalosporin, and macrolide antibiotics had been prescribed before her admission. She was a non-smoker with unremarkable past medical history.\n",
      "On admission the body temperature was 36.6℃, the heart rate was 84/min, the respiration rate was 20/minute and the blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg. On physical examination, the patient was alert and not in great discomfort. There was a crackle sound over the left lower lung zone. There was no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Detailed examination of the cardiovascular system and abdomen was unremarkable. Chest radiography disclosed a pneumonic infiltration on the left lower lung field and there was no cardiomegaly (). Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the chest revealed a consolidation with air-bronchogram in the left lower lobe and a small amount of pleural effusion (). The complete blood count showed a normal white cell count (8.4×109/L). There was no hypoxemia on the blood gas analysis (pH 7.4, PaCO2 37.2 mmHg, SaO2 98%) when she was breathing room air. The other laboratory investigations showed normal electrolytes and renal and liver function tests. The fasting glucose was normal. The serum anti-HIV antibody was negative. The serum immunoglobulin levels (including IgG, IgA and IgM) were normal. Pulmonary function testing showed a mild restrictive pattern (the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) was 2.50/2.32L; the ratio was 93%), and there was a normal diffusion coefficient for carbon monoxide (DLco: 109%). The initial examination of the sputum for acid-fast bacilli with gram staining and culture did not reveal any organisms. The blood culture was sterile after 7 days incubation. We then conducted a bronchoscopic examination. There were no endobronchial abnormalities. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed the lymphodominant nature (a lymphocyte count of 70%, the macrophages were 28%). The BAL fluid culture was negative and there were neither acid-fast bacilli nor any pathogens.\n",
      "During the first six days of this patient's admission to our hospital, her annoying respiratory symptoms and lung consolidation did not improved for all the combination antibiotic treatment (intravenous cefuroxime and oral clarithromycin). We performed a subsequent computed tomography guided percutaneous needle biopsy on the sixth hospital day. The tissue pathology revealed granulomatous lesion including multinucleated giant cells and fungal spores. The specimens were stained with Hematoxilin-Eosin, mucicarmine, Gomori-Methenamine silver (GMS), and periodic-acid-Schiff (PAS). The Hematoxilin-Eosin and GMS stain showed granulomatous inflammation with numerous yeast-like organisms that were surrounded by clear halos, and these organisms were present within multinucleated giant cells and in the intercellular spaces (). Mucicarmine staining for capsular material was negative. With performing additional Fontana-Masson silver staining (FMS), the black color in the walls of the organism was disclosed (). This special stain pattern is a characteristic of C. neoformans, and especially for the capsule deficient form. Subsequently, the antibiotic regimen was replaced by 1-week of once-a-day intravenous fluconazole treatment and the patient was discharged on oral fluconazole. Further cultures of the lung specimen yielded moderate growth of Cryptococcus neoformans afterward. During the 6-months follow up period her respiratory symptoms and abnormal radiologic feature were markedly improved ().\n",

      "A 15-year-old female presented in preanesthetic checkup clinic for rush nail removal of femur. She was a known case of OI type I and history of recurrent fractures for which she had been operated three times uneventfully under general anesthesia. There was no history of OI in the family.\n",
      "On general examination, she was short statured with a height of 103 cm, weighing 49 kg, blue sclera, fragile bones, progressive hearing loss, kyphoscoliosis. Her blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, and heart rate was 80 beats/min. There was no pallor, icterus, cyanosis, clubbing, lymphadenopathy, or pedal edema. Respiratory system revealed barrel-shaped chest with bilateral equal air entry, and cardiovascular system revealed normal heart sounds. Electrocardiogram (ECG), liver function test, renal function test, and coagulation profile were normal. Chest X-ray was normal except mediastinal widening; X-ray of the spine revealed dorsolumbar kyphoscoliosis to the left. Pulmonary function test was suggestive of mildly restrictive disease. Airway assessment showed acceptable flexion and extension at neck with adequate mouth opening and normal dentition, Mallampatti Class III. The patient was accepted for surgery as American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade III; in view odontoaxial dislocation and normal coagulation profile, we decided to proceed with a spinal anesthetic technique. Thorough operating room preparation was completed including difficult airway equipment, and measures made ready to deal with hyperthermias if any.\n",

      "A 46 years old female with a history of unspecified arthritis presented to the emergency department with complaints of substernal chest pain and right leg numbness of one-hour duration. The chest pain was radiating to the left shoulder and was associated with diaphoresis and dyspnea. On examination, vitals revealed a blood pressure of 92/69 mmHg, heart rate of 54/min, oxygen saturation of 100% on room air, and afebrile at 98.3°F. There was a soft systolic murmur in the right upper sternal border. Pulsation on dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery and sensation on right lower extremity was decreased. Electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed complete heart block with junctional escape rhythm and ST elevation in anterior precordial leads with ST depression in leads I and aVL (Figure ). Pertinent labs revealed initial troponin-I of 0.05 ng/ml. The remaining blood work, including complete blood count and the basic metabolic panel, was unremarkable.\n",
      "In the emergency department, the patient received immediate dual antiplatelet therapy, and cutaneous pacer pads were applied. Due to the focal exam findings, a computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) was performed rapidly with quick review ruling out dissection. CTA however revealed a small transverse, linear defect in the proximal aorta (Figure ). This defect was noted to propagate towards the root of the aortic valve on its anterior leaflet suggesting possible vegetation on the aortic valve. Given the ST changes and ongoing chest pain, the patient was taken immediately for cardiac catheterization which revealed a distal thrombus in the posterior left ventricular branch of the right coronary artery which was not amenable for intervention (Figures , ). During cardiac catheterization, right lower extremity pain and coolness suddenly worsened. Angiogram of the right lower extremity showed 100% occlusion of the right anterior and posterior tibial arteries (Figure ). The patient then went for emergent thrombo-embolectomy of the right tibio-peroneal trunk, with a marked resolution of symptoms. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed later confirming the vegetation in the aortic valve measuring about 6.5x4.0 mm (Figure ). Three sets of blood cultures were negative. Significant remarkable lab findings included C-reactive protein (CRP) of 10.5 ng/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 60 mm/hr, and positive rheumatoid arthritis screen. Extensive rheumatological and hypercoagulable workup including anti-nuclear antibodies, complement levels, anti-thrombin III activity, protein C & S levels, homocysteine levels, and other procoagulant markers were within the normal range. Specific testing for systemic scleroderma, Sjogren’s, and polymyositis were also unremarkable. Confirmatory testing with anti-cyclic citrullinated protein showed levels of >250 units establishing the diagnosis of RA. The patient was treated with systemic oral anticoagulation and was initiated on steroids.\n",

      "An eighty-five-year-old female presented to the emergency room with complaints of sudden onset substernal chest pain and dizziness. Her past medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation. She had a pacemaker inserted at another facility 2 weeks before. No perioperative complications were reported and patient had been doing well without any complaints till the day of presentation. Medications included dabigatran for her atrial fibrillation. On examination, the patient was diaphoretic but in no respiratory distress. Temperature was 97°F, pulse 96/minute, irregular; systolic blood pressure was 70 mm Hg; respiratory rate was 22/minute; and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. No jugular venous distension was noted. Cardiac examination revealed irregular rhythm, no murmur or rub. Lung auscultation revealed slightly diminished breath sounds at left base. Chest X-ray showed a mild-to-moderate left-sided pleural effusion; pacemaker leads appeared to be in the right ventricle (). Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed trioventricular (AV) sequential pacing (). Echocardiogram (ECHO) revealed no wall motion abnormality with normal ejection fraction. Pacemaker leads were visualized in the right ventricle (RV) on ECHO. Her hemoglobin was 8 gm%; prothrombin time (PT) was 19 seconds; and INR was 2.9.\n",
      "No pacing or sensing failure was noted on device interrogation. The patient's hypotension persisted despite vigorous intravenous fluid resuscitation including transfusion of 2 units of blood cell and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma and improvement in her hemoglobin to 11 gm%. A computed tomogram (CT) of the chest was performed which showed a moderate left pleural effusion, with the pacemaker wire extending to the left pleural cavity and a small localized pericardial effusion adjoining the pleural effusion (). The patient's hemodynamic instability was not due to tamponade effect as the pericardial effusion was small but due to continued hemorrhage into the pleural cavity due to her coagulopathic state from being on dabigatran for her atrial fibrillation, which was not fully corrected by fresh frozen plasma infusion.\n",
      "The patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent a median sternotomy. The pacemaker lead was found to be protruding out of the right ventricle (). The external portion was cut with the remaining intracardiac portion of the pacemaker lead left in place. The perforation of the RV wall was repaired. The hemothorax and hemopericardium were evacuated. Subsequently, the patient's hemodynamic status improved. Two days later, the remaining portion of the pacemaker lead was removed transvenously. A new pacemaker was inserted transvenously and placed on the right ventricular septum. The patient did not have further complications and was discharged home subsequently.

On initial presentation, respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute, heart rate was 130 beats per minute, blood pressure was 196/102 mmHg, and oxygen saturation was 91% on room air. Physical examination was notable for normal oral mucosa with increased lacrimation, patent airway, diminished breath sounds with bilateral rales, and no accessory muscle use []. He was alert and oriented without any focal neurologic deficits. He was immediately placed on a non-rebreather mask.\n",
      "The white blood cell count was 11.2 109/L. Arterial blood gas revealed the following: pH 7.410, pCO2 37.2 mmHg, pO2 104 mmHg on 100% FiO2. Chest radiograph demonstrated right middle and lower lobe infiltrates (Figure ) []. Chest computed tomography (CT) with contrast showed patchy airspace disease and air bronchograms in the aforementioned areas with a right infrahilar mass measuring 3.3 × 2.6 cm near the right middle lobe bronchi (Figure ) [].\n",
      "He was admitted to the intensive care unit, ultimately requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Sputum and blood cultures drawn on admission revealed no growth. A repeat chest radiograph demonstrated the development of a pleural effusion, felt to be parapneumonic. A thoracentesis was performed with removal of 300 cc of yellow-colored fluid []. Pleural fluid analysis was exudative with a negative gram stain and culture. Bronchoscopy demonstrated friable mucosa in the bronchi of the right middle and lower lobes []. Purulent fluid was noted, which was suggestive of abscess formation. Gram stain of the aspirated fluid was remarkable for white blood cells without organisms.\n",
      "The patient underwent thoracotomy with right middle lobe resection []. Surgical pathology revealed extensive acute and chronic inflammation with lipoid droplets, extensive necrosis, and obliteration of alveolar spaces. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of necrotizing lipoid pneumonia with abscess formation following hydrocarbon aspiration. The patient’s hospitalization was further complicated by an acute cerebellar stroke. He required tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.

Chest computed tomography (CT) with contrast showed patchy airspace disease and air bronchograms in the aforementioned areas with a right infrahilar mass measuring 3.3 × 2.6 cm near the right middle lobe bronchi (Figure ) [].\n",
      "He was admitted to the intensive care unit, ultimately requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Sputum and blood cultures drawn on admission revealed no growth. A repeat chest radiograph demonstrated the development of a pleural effusion, felt to be parapneumonic. A thoracentesis was performed with removal of 300 cc of yellow-colored fluid []. Pleural fluid analysis was exudative with a negative gram stain and culture. Bronchoscopy demonstrated friable mucosa in the bronchi of the right middle and lower lobes []. Purulent fluid was noted, which was suggestive of abscess formation. Gram stain of the aspirated fluid was remarkable for white blood cells without organisms.\n",
      "The patient underwent thoracotomy with right middle lobe resection []. Surgical pathology revealed extensive acute and chronic inflammation with lipoid droplets, extensive necrosis, and obliteration of alveolar spaces. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of necrotizing lipoid pneumonia with abscess formation following hydrocarbon aspiration. The patient’s hospitalization was further complicated by an acute cerebellar stroke. He required tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. He was ultimately discharged to a long-term acute care hospital.\n",

      "A 35-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome was admitted at 37 weeks gestational age (GA). She was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome at 16 years of age. A previous pregnancy at 33 years of age culminated in a missed abortion at 6 weeks GA, for which a dilatation and curettage was performed at our hospital under monitored anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. She underwent a Bentall operation due to aortic regurgitation at 20 years of age. She underwent a vitrectomy at 27 years of age for subluxation of the right lens. She had orthostatic headaches 3 years ago, and dural ectasia at the 5th lumbar and sacrum, which was identified on lumborsacral spine magnetic resonance myelography, was thought to be the cause of the symptoms. At the time of admission, she had a 35-mm abdominal aortic aneurysm for 8 years. The cardiac functions were stable because the previous aortic surgical procedures were well-maintained during the current pregnancy. She was medicated with verapamil, atenolol, and warfarin, which were switched to labetalol and enoxaparin during the pregnancy.\n",
      "She had the pathognomic body habitus of Marfan syndrome (height, 179 cm; weight, 76.2 kg; and arachnodactyly). A metallic click and systolic murmur were auscultated with a stethoscope. Her initial vital signs showed a blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 80/min, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. A pre-operative echocardiography revealed a normal left ventricle ejection fraction (55-60%) and a well-functioning prosthetic aortic valve. Mild ectatic changes in the proximal descending thoracic aorta and distal abdominal aorta (32 × 36 and 34 × 31 mm, respectively) were confirmed with no interval changes compared to the last study checked 1 year ago.\n",
      "An elective cesarean section was recommended by the obstetricians, cardiologists, and anesthesiologists involved in the patient's care. Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia is the standard anesthetic choice for cesarean section at our hospital. However, the presence of dural ectasia at the 5th lumbar and sacrum, and a neurosurgeon's warning against spinal anesthesia for the possible recurrence of headache associated with CSF leakage, led us to decide on epidural anesthesia. Enoxaparin was discontinued one day before the scheduled cesarean section and unfractionated conventional heparin was administered until 6 hours before the operation.\n",
      "With the patient in the right lateral position, a 17-gauge Tuohy needle was inserted at the L3-4 interspace under sterile conditions using a midline approach with the loss-ofair resistance technique. Then, a 19-gauge epidural catheter (FlexTip Plus®; Arrow, USA) was inserted via the Tuohy needle and fixed at 9 cm. Eight ml of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine (1 : 200,000) and fentanyl (50 µg) were injected via an epidural catheter as a divided first dose, and the total 27 ml of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine (1 : 200,000) and fentanyl (100 µg) was injected incrementally over 10 minutes. Twenty minutes after the last epidural injection of lidocaine, the sensory block was sufficiently high (T4) for the cesarean section. The systolic blood pressure was decreased by 25% and 3 doses of phenylephrine (100 µg) and 1 dose of ephedrine (10 mg) were administered to maintain the blood pressure at 100/50 mmHg. She was sedated with propofol after the infant was delivered and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. The baby had been diagnosed prenatally with possible Marfan syndrome and was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. The patient's post-operative vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 106/68 mmHg, a heart rate of 83/min, and an oxygen saturation of 100%. Heparin was re-infused 6 hours after the cesarean section. The post-operative pain was managed with patient-controlled epidural analgesia for 3 days post-operatively. The epidural catheter was removed 6 hours after stopping the continuous heparin injection on the 3rd post-operative day. She was transferred to the Cardiology Department for postpartum management and discharged without cardiovascular complications.\n",

      "A 73-year-old woman presented with three days of progressively worsening sharp non-radiating reproducible left-sided thoracic pain exacerbated by movement of the ipsilateral upper extremity. Her past medical history was significant for a myocardial infarction two decades prior with resultant ischemic cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and a biventricular pacemaker and defibrillator in place. Initial examination revealed normal vital signs, non-distended neck veins, and left-sided chest wall tenderness to palpation. Electrocardiography displayed a ventricular-paced rhythm and left bundle branch block not meeting the Sgarbossa criteria for ischemia. Three serial troponin I assays were negative. Chest radiograph showed dual chamber pacer wires in place without cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusions. Biventricular pacemaker interrogation revealed no arrhythmic events but indicated the need for battery replacement. Her symptoms were attributed to noncardiac musculoskeletal chest pain, and she was discharged home with plans for elective pacemaker battery replacement.\n",
      "Two weeks later, the patient presented with dyspnea, orthopnea, and retrosternal chest pain. On physical examination, the patient was afebrile, and she had a blood pressure of 172/64 mmHg, pulse rate of 67 beats/minute, and respiration rate of 18 breaths/minute. Her oxygen saturation was 99% on 3 L of oxygen per minute. Cardiac examination revealed non-distended neck veins, normal heart sounds, diminished bilateral lung sounds, and mild bilateral pedal edema. Electrocardiogram was similar to the prior, and serial cardiac enzymes were normal. The brain natriuretic peptide level was elevated at 2,042 pg/mL. Chest radiograph showed increased vascular markings and cardiomegaly. Immediate intravenous loop diuretics and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation were initiated with symptomatic improvement. In the setting of unstable angina with decompensated heart failure, urgent cardiac catheterization was performed, revealing a totally occluded right coronary artery, normal left coronaries, and a calcified, well-demarcated, large left ventricular infero-basal aneurysm with a 28 mm neck opening (Figure ). Cardiac computed tomography with angiography (Figures and 3) and transesophageal echocardiography (Figure ) showed a 46 x 45 x 47 mm aneurysm originating just at the takeoff of the posterior mitral valve leaflet (increased in size when compared with prior images) and severe mitral regurgitation. The patient underwent surgical mitral valve repair, aneurysmectomy, and pericardial patching. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 30%-35% to 40%-45% postoperatively. Following the initial recovery period, the patient reported better exercise tolerance and improved quality of life, and she did not require further heart failure or angina-related hospitalizations to date.\n",

      "A 64-year-old African American man presented to a university hospital with one-week history of worsening dyspnea, cough, and lower extremity edema. He endorses frequently forgetting to take his medications as well as nonadherence with dietary and fluid restrictions. Past medical history is pertinent for morbid obesity, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (prior radiofrequency ablation, currently anticoagulated), coronary artery disease (prior stent to mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery), hypertension, ventricular septal defect (VSD), and previous motor vehicle collision approximately ten years prior.\n",
      "Upon arrival to the emergency department, he was noted to have blood pressure of 106/77 with heart rate of 94 and respirations of 23. He was saturating at 86% on 4-5 L nasal cannula and was subsequently started on Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) to improve respiratory status. Physical exam was notable for bibasilar crackles, grades II/VI holosystolic murmur, mildly elevated jugular venous pressure, and 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema. Admission labs were unremarkable (including normal B-natriuretic peptide, troponin-I, and albumin). Chest X-ray demonstrated interstitial pulmonary vascular congestion (), and EKG was sinus tachycardia with first-degree AV block. He was admitted to the cardiology inpatient service for continued management of presumed acute decompensated heart failure.\n",
      "Given the persistent hypoxemia, transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) were ordered. TTE demonstrated normal biventricular systolic function, grade 2 diastolic dysfunction, and a small, 5 mm distal inferoseptal/apical VSD (). CTPA was without evidence of pulmonary embolism but did demonstrate a 6.4 × 4.3 cm calcified lesion concerning for giant LAD coronary artery aneurysm (), though image quality was limited by lack of gating. Diuresis was continued with symptomatic improvement, but given these findings, the decision was made to proceed with invasive angiography.\n",
      "Heart catheterization revealed elevated right-sided (right atrium (RA) 9 mmHg, right ventricle (RV) 52/12 mmHg, pulmonary artery 71/29 mmHg (mean 45 mmHg), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 mmHg), and left-sided pressures (left ventricle 183/31 mmHg, systemic arterial pressure 171/97 mmHg (mean 128 mmHg)) without evidence of step-up intracardiac RV shunt (RA 59%, RV 61% saturation). There was elevated cardiac output (Fick—11.1 L/min (index 4.39 L/min); Thermodilution—14.4 L/min (index 5.73 L/min). Coronary angiography revealed mild luminal irregularities only, with normal ejection fraction and no evidence of LAD aneurysm (). There was no apparent mass lesion evident with fluoroscopy and ventriculogram showed normal left ventricular wall motion.\n",
      "Follow-up imaging was performed to elucidate these findings, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) clarified the anomaly as a 5.4 × 4.1 × 4.9 cm pseudoaneurysm arising from the mid-apical free wall of the RV with a 9 mm neck (). Cardiac CT angiogram was well performed and confirmed pseudoaneurysm arising superiorly from the mid-apical free wall of the RV measuring up to 6.1 cm in maximal diameter with a 15 mm neck as well as 4 × 11 mm mid-apical VSD (). A review of the previously performed CTPA was conducted at this point and revealed a previously healed rib fracture anterior to the pseudoaneurysm ().\n",
      "Given the high output heart failure noted on angiography, an abdominal ultrasound was performed and revealed evidence of a cirrhotic liver. Upon further questioning, our patient admitted to prior longstanding alcohol abuse, now in remission.

      "A 65-year-old male presented with an abrupt onset of sharp, burning, constant right lower abdominal pain after previously been feeling well. There was no history of trauma, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, dysuria, hematuria or melena. His past medical history included hypertension, atrial flutter and cardiomyopathy, and he had an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD). There was no prior history of abdominal aortic aneurysm in the patient or in his family. His past surgical history included an inguinal hernia repair. His medications included aspirin, valsartan, metoprolol and atorvastatin. He did not smoke, use alcohol or illicit drugs.\n",
      "Physical exam showed vitals signs as follows: body temperature of 36.3°C, blood pressure of 140/82 mmHg, heart rate of 52 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and pulsoximetry of 98% on room air. He was alert, but appeared in mild distress due to pain. His abdominal exam revealed tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, with no rebound, guarding, distention or organomegaly. The remainder of the exam was normal.\n",
      "The initial emergency department evaluation included an electrocardiogram that showed atrial flutter with a 4:1 block. Laboratory assessment revealed trace hematuria, no leukocytosis, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL (normal range, 0.7–1.4 mg/dL), mildly elevated lipase to 85 U/L (normal range, 12–70 U/L), mild hyperglycemia and mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase to 46 U/L (normal range, 7–40 U/L). The lactate and coagulation profiles were within normal limits. Lactate dehydrogenase was not ordered at presentation, but obtained 2 days after admission, and was elevated at 1,479 U/L (normal range, 100–220 U/L). Lactate dehydrogenase is present in the renal tissue and elevates in serum after kidney insult, and it is unknown whether this level correlates to the severity of the infarct.\n",
      "Given the nature of the pain and the hematuria seen on urinalysis and the history of cardiomyopathy with atrial flutter, both nephrolithiasis and mesenteric ischemia were strongly considered as causes for this acute pain. Therefore, both non-contrast- and contrast-enhanced helical computed tomography (CT) images [Figures and ] were obtained, which showed extensive infarction involving the upper pole of the right kidney with multiple patchy infarcts into the lower pole, a patent right renal artery, but no visualization of the interparenchymal arterial branches within the mid and upper poles of the right kidney, suggesting arterial thromboembolic disease. There was poor opacification of the right renal vein, and, therefore, renal vein thrombus could not be ruled out. A 2-mm left renal calculus was also identified.\n",
      "The urology and vascular surgery services were consulted, and both recommended conservative treatment with anticoagulation. In addition to normal saline and dilaudid for pain control, a heparin bolus of 80 mg/kg was given and an infusion at 18 mg/kg/h was initiated, with the patient being admitted to the general medicine service.\n",

      "A 77-year-old African American female came to our hospital complaining of shortness of breath. The patient was experiencing severe left-sided abdominal pain for the past two weeks. It was not associated with any alleviating or aggravating factors. On the day of presentation, she became lightheaded and experience shortness of breath. The discomfort was associated with two episodes of nonbloody emesis and left-sided pleuritic chest pain. She did not have any retrosternal chest pain, diaphoresis, or syncopal episode. She was, additionally, complaining of right lower leg cramping. Her medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and deep vein thrombosis, which was treated with an oral anticoagulant for six months. The initial vitals were blood pressure of 125/62 mmHg, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air; she was afebrile. The cardiopulmonary exam was unremarkable. The initial troponin level was 0.02 ng/mL (normal: 0–0.10 ng/mL), eight hours apart. The pro-BNP level was at 7511 pg/mL (normal: 50–92 pg/mL). An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without significant findings. A CT-chest with contrast showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary emboli in the right and left main pulmonary arteries and straightening of the interventricular septum suggestive of right ventricular strain (). The echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction, hypokinetic RV, mild pulmonary hypertension (RVSP of 49 mmHg), and RV/LV > 1 (). The ultrasound with Doppler of the lower extremities did not show deep vein thrombosis.\n",
      "The patient was diagnosed with submassive PE, and she was decided to be treated with UAT. The UAT catheters were placed in both arteries and local alteplase was administered for 12 mg with heparin over 12 hours after receiving 2 mg of bolus. There were no peri- or postprocedural complications. The next day, the patient experienced marked improvement in dyspnea. Next day, a repeated echocardiography showed preserved ejection fraction with mildly depressed right ventricular function with RV/LV <1 () and RVSP of 40 mmHg.

      "A 77-year-old African American female came to our hospital complaining of shortness of breath. The patient was experiencing severe left-sided abdominal pain for the past two weeks. It was not associated with any alleviating or aggravating factors. On the day of presentation, she became lightheaded and experience shortness of breath. The discomfort was associated with two episodes of nonbloody emesis and left-sided pleuritic chest pain. She did not have any retrosternal chest pain, diaphoresis, or syncopal episode. She was, additionally, complaining of right lower leg cramping. Her medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and deep vein thrombosis, which was treated with an oral anticoagulant for six months. The initial vitals were blood pressure of 125/62 mmHg, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air; she was afebrile. The cardiopulmonary exam was unremarkable. The initial troponin level was 0.02 ng/mL (normal: 0–0.10 ng/mL), eight hours apart. The pro-BNP level was at 7511 pg/mL (normal: 50–92 pg/mL). An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without significant findings. A CT-chest with contrast showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary emboli in the right and left main pulmonary arteries and straightening of the interventricular septum suggestive of right ventricular strain (). The echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction, hypokinetic RV, mild pulmonary hypertension (RVSP of 49 mmHg), and RV/LV > 1 (). The ultrasound with Doppler of the lower extremities did not show deep vein thrombosis.\n",
      "The patient was diagnosed with submassive PE, and she was decided to be treated with UAT. The UAT catheters were placed in both arteries and local alteplase was administered for 12 mg with heparin over 12 hours after receiving 2 mg of bolus. There were no peri- or postprocedural complications. The next day, the patient experienced marked improvement in dyspnea. Next day, a repeated echocardiography showed preserved ejection fraction with mildly depressed right ventricular function with RV/LV <1 () and RVSP of 40 mmHg. The patient was discharged on oral rivaroxaban. Refer to for data summary.\n",

      "A 40-year-old Hispanic woman called 911 for worsening chest tightness, generalized weakness and vomiting of two days. On arrival, paramedics performed an EKG that revealed sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at 160–180 beats/minute. Blood pressure and oxygen saturation were normal. She was treated with 40 mg intravenous lidocaine after which she converted to normal sinus rhythm. In the emergency department (ED), she was alert and complained of weakness of all four extremities. She denied shortness of breath. She had a history of hyperthyroidism and hypertension but took no medicines. Vital signs were blood pressure of 126/70 mm of Hg, pulse of 90 beats/minute and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute. She was afebrile, and oxygen saturation was 96% in room air. Cardiac and lung examinations were normal. There was no thyromegaly. Neurological examination showed 2/6 strength and hypoactive reflexes in all four extremities. Cranial nerves and sensations were normal. Initial laboratory tests showed potassium of 2.3 mEq/L (normal: 3.5–5.5mEq/L) with normal anion gap. Magnesium, chloride, calcium and creatinine were normal. Urinary toxicology screen was negative. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. In the ED the patient received 40 mEq of oral potassium chloride, and intravenous (IV) potassium was started at 20 mEq/hour. Repeat laboratory testing after three hours showed potassium of 1.9 mEq/L. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was low (0.01μunit/ml; normal: 0.5–5.0 μunit/ml) with high free thyroxine (7.77 ng/dL; normal: 0.75 to 1.8 ng/dL). The patient complained of worsening weakness in her legs. She was given additional 40 mEq of oral potassium. Potassium was increased to 30 mEq/hour IV, and the patient was admitted to medical intensive care unit.\n",
      "A diagnosis of TPP was made based on clinical presentation and laboratory results. Blood drawn after eight hours showed potassium of 6.6 mEq/L. Intravenous potassium was stopped, and intravenous dose of 1 gm calcium, 50% solution of 50 ml dextrose, and 10 units of insulin were given urgently to correct hyperkalemia. Despite these, the patient developed episodes of ventricular fibrillation and despite several attempts at electrical cardioversion, she died. Her potassium level was 10.1 mEq/L at the time of her death.\n",

      "A 29-year-old man presented to the emergency department after one week of repeated bouts of crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea, which became bloody on the day of arrival. There was no fever, nausea, or vomiting.\n",
      "He was evaluated several times in the Emergency Medicine Department during the previous three months, with various abdominal complaints that resolved after symptomatic relief without further investigation. The patient reported no additional symptoms or relevant personal or familial medical history. He worked as a bus driver, smoked cigarettes for many years, and did not drink alcohol regularly.\n",
      "The patient reported daily usage of “Mr. Nice Guy” for the last few months but denied use of any other drugs or supplements. Consumption of SCs was via smoking, and he denied other means of administration such as oral or intravenous. This information was validated by collateral anamnesis of visiting friends.\n",
      "In the emergency department, the patient was hemodynamically stable with initial BP recordings of 159/100 mmHg, regular heart rate of 99 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 99% on ambient air. Physical examination was unremarkable except for intense borborygmi and mild abnormal tenderness. Initial blood work showed leukocytosis of 20,000 cells/mcL with neutrophilia (80%) and normal hemoglobin (15.1 grams/dL). Biochemistry, including electrolytes, kidney function tests, liver, and pancreatic enzymes, were all within normal limits. Urinalysis was unremarkable, and urine toxicology screen was slightly positive for amphetamines and benzodiazepines but negative for other screened drugs including THC, opiates, and cocaine. Upon repeated questioning, patient once again denied use of any other stimulant including amphetamines, besides “Mr. Nice Guy.” White cell count increased to 28,000 cells/mcL six hours later, and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) performed without IV or PO contrast enhancement was unremarkable. Over the next four days the patient continued to complain of intermittent episodes of crampy abdominal pain with episodic diarrhea, followed by pain-free periods during which he strolled freely around the hospital, admitting that he was still smoking “Mr. Nice Guy,” provided to him by his friends. Additional toxic screens were not performed during hospitalization due to lack of the patient's cooperation. Leukocytosis gradually resolved. Blood, stool, and urinary cultures were negative and other laboratory data were unremarkable, with the exception of hypophosphatemia (0.5 mmol/L, normal = 0.8–1.4) and increasing C-reactive protein (22 mg/dL, normal < 0.5 mg/dL). During his hospitalization we abstained giving the patient medications from the family of benzodiazepines, potent opiates, and any medications which involve potential future addiction.\n",
      "On the fifth hospitalization day, an abdominal X-ray, taken during a bout of abdominal pain, demonstrated dilated small bowel loops without features of intestinal obstruction or perforation, consistent with paralytic ileus. Later that day, the pain subsided and the patient requested to take a walk around the hospital, as our internal medicine ward regulations permit stable patients to leave their rooms. Obviously, hospitalized patients are not permitted to use any form of drug or medication not provided to them by hospital staff.\n",
      "However upon returning from his walk, the patient admitted that he had once again consumed “Mr. Nice Guy” with one a friend who came to visit him. Routine checkup of vital signs revealed elevated blood pressure 180/110 mmHg with a heart rate of 120/min, without fever. Six hours later, he developed sudden extreme abdominal pain and was found to be in profound shock vomiting “coffee ground” material. Physical examination revealed abdominal guarding and rebound tenderness compatible with peritonitis, and laboratory evaluation disclosed hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, and worsening kidney function. An emergent surgical intervention was considered for an evolving abdominal catastrophe, but the patient quickly went into pulseless electrical activity with subsequent cardiac arrest.\n",
      "A request for autopsy was declined by the patient's family, but a postmortem CT scan one hour after death revealed extensive pneumatosis intestinalis of the entire small bowel, right colon and sigmoid, gas in the portal system, and blood vessels, with free air and unclear fluid in the peritoneal cavity (Figures and ). These findings were consistent with acute intestinal perforation most probably due to a nonobstructive mesenteric infarction (NOMI) as the cause of death. There was no evidence of single vessel infarction, rather of diffuse ischemia, possibly due to splanchnic vasospasm. Air in the aorta, right ventricle, and biliary tract were conceivably postmortem changes. Urinary toxic screen sampled during hemodynamic resuscitation was positive for methadone, THC, and benzodiazepines, but negative for cocaine, opiates, and amphetamines. Unfortunately, due to technical failure, the final urine sample was not sent for confirmatory mass spectrometry testing.\n",

      "Our IV team was requested to insert a central line for parenteral nutrition in a 70-year-old female patient (weight: 57 kg; height: 160 cm; ASA: 2). Two days earlier, the patient had undergone intestinal and colic resections under general and epidural anaesthesia with a suspected diagnosis of pelvic abscess. No hysterectomy was performed during the intervention. Postoperative diagnosis was an endometrial adenocarcinoma with colic parietal infiltration through to the mucosa.\n",
      "Prior to the procedure, our patient's transcutaneous oxygen saturation was 97% in room air, blood pressure was 135/80 mmHg, and pulse rate was regular at 110/minute. The patient has no history of pulmonary or pleural disease (), no history of cardiothoracic surgery or thoracic radiotherapy. No earlier central line placement insertions had been performed.\n",
      "After placement of noninvasive monitoring a nasal prongs oxygen delivery device was installed administrating 2 L/minute of oxygen. Under maximal aseptic barrier protection a local anaesthesia with 1% lignocaine was placed under the right clavicula and a 18 Gauge introducer needle was introduced mid-clavicularly. The pleural space was punctured twice with the introducer needle after 2.5 cm, confirmed by the presence of air in the syringe. About one minute later, the patient started to complain of pain situated in the right side of the chest that increased at inspiration but without respiratory distress. Her oxygen saturation was at this stage 96%.\n",
      "Subsequently the site of puncture was moved 2 cm medial compared to the first insertion site and the right subclavian vein was directly punctured at a depth of approximately 3 cm, just under the right-sided sterno-clavicular junction. The entire procedure was completed without any further complications and the patient's oxygen saturation was 94% at the end of the procedure.\n",
      "A chest radiograph performed approximately ten minutes after the wound dressing revealed a complete left-side pneumothorax and a mild right-side pneumothorax (). At this time, the patient was starting to complain of respiratory distress. Her respiratory rate was 18/minute and her oxygen saturation was 91% with supplemental oxygen of 8 L/minute. Her pulse rate was 140/minute and her blood pressure 144/81 mmHg.\n",
      "Thoracic surgeons were called and they inserted a chest tube on the left side of the chest. No clinical improvement was noticed and the patient had in between an oxygen saturation of 84% despite a face mask oxygen delivery device with reservoir.\n",
      "A second chest radiograph was performed and showed a complete right-side tension pneumothorax that was not present on the prior radiograph (). The size of the left pneumothorax had decreased after the chest tube insertion. A second chest tube was inserted on the right side and the patient's symptoms resolved and oxygen saturation normalized.\n",
      "Two days later a computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed persistent bilateral pneumothoraces and leftwards mediastinal shift, the chest tubes were wellplaced, and there were bilateral pleural effusions; furthermore, important bilateral subcutaneous emphysema was present. There was no evidence of emphysema or bulla in the partially expanded nonatelectatic lung parenchyma.\n",

      "Our IV team was requested to insert a central line for parenteral nutrition in a 70-year-old female patient (weight: 57 kg; height: 160 cm; ASA: 2). Two days earlier, the patient had undergone intestinal and colic resections under general and epidural anaesthesia with a suspected diagnosis of pelvic abscess. No hysterectomy was performed during the intervention. Postoperative diagnosis was an endometrial adenocarcinoma with colic parietal infiltration through to the mucosa.\n",
      "Prior to the procedure, our patient's transcutaneous oxygen saturation was 97% in room air, blood pressure was 135/80 mmHg, and pulse rate was regular at 110/minute. The patient has no history of pulmonary or pleural disease (), no history of cardiothoracic surgery or thoracic radiotherapy. No earlier central line placement insertions had been performed.\n",
      "After placement of noninvasive monitoring a nasal prongs oxygen delivery device was installed administrating 2 L/minute of oxygen. Under maximal aseptic barrier protection a local anaesthesia with 1% lignocaine was placed under the right clavicula and a 18 Gauge introducer needle was introduced mid-clavicularly. The pleural space was punctured twice with the introducer needle after 2.5 cm, confirmed by the presence of air in the syringe. About one minute later, the patient started to complain of pain situated in the right side of the chest that increased at inspiration but without respiratory distress. Her oxygen saturation was at this stage 96%.\n",
      "Subsequently the site of puncture was moved 2 cm medial compared to the first insertion site and the right subclavian vein was directly punctured at a depth of approximately 3 cm, just under the right-sided sterno-clavicular junction. The entire procedure was completed without any further complications and the patient's oxygen saturation was 94% at the end of the procedure.\n",
      "A chest radiograph performed approximately ten minutes after the wound dressing revealed a complete left-side pneumothorax and a mild right-side pneumothorax (). At this time, the patient was starting to complain of respiratory distress. Her respiratory rate was 18/minute and her oxygen saturation was 91% with supplemental oxygen of 8 L/minute. Her pulse rate was 140/minute and her blood pressure 144/81 mmHg.\n",
      "Thoracic surgeons were called and they inserted a chest tube on the left side of the chest. No clinical improvement was noticed and the patient had in between an oxygen saturation of 84% despite a face mask oxygen delivery device with reservoir.\n",
      "A second chest radiograph was performed and showed a complete right-side tension pneumothorax that was not present on the prior radiograph (). The size of the left pneumothorax had decreased after the chest tube insertion. A second chest tube was inserted on the right side and the patient's symptoms resolved and oxygen saturation normalized.\n",
      "Two days later a computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed persistent bilateral pneumothoraces and leftwards mediastinal shift, the chest tubes were wellplaced, and there were bilateral pleural effusions; furthermore, important bilateral subcutaneous emphysema was present. There was no evidence of emphysema or bulla in the partially expanded nonatelectatic lung parenchyma.\n",
      "Seven days later, thoracic tubes were removed and one month later, after the first cycle of chemotherapy, the central venous catheter was taken off. Seven days later the patient was discharged without any further complications.\n",

      "A 68-year-old man attended the Accident and Emergency department with increasing breathlessness but no chest pain, sputum production or haemoptysis. He had recently returned from holiday in Spain and his general practitioner prescribed amoxicillin for a presumed chest infection. He was a diet-controlled type 2 diabetic on treatment for hypertension. He had a 40-pack-year smoking history and had lost 4 kg in weight. Examination revealed an obese man with normal blood pressure, sinus tachycardia at 100 beats⋅min−1, with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths⋅min−1. His oxygen saturation was 96% on air. His white cell count was 11×109 cells⋅L−1 and C-reactive protein was 92 mg⋅L−1. Renal function and coagulation studies were normal.\n",
      "The admitting medical team felt that there was a “complete whiteout” of the left hemithorax and initially treated him for suspected severe community-­acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics and fluids, while arranging a respiratory opinion. Prophylactic low molecular weight ­heparin (LMWH) was also started. The respiratory team felt that an underlying malignancy may have been responsible for the radiographic appearances of left upper lobe collapse and suggested a ­computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax. shows a “veil-like” opacity projected over the left lung field, a raised left hemidiaphragm with blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with left upper lobe collapse, volume loss and an associated pleural effusion.\n",
      "The CT scan showed a large left hilar mass coalescing with the left upper lobe collapse. There were associated large para-aortic, subcarinal, mediastinal and supraclavicular nodes, a single liver metastasis and a second separate mass in the right lung. Lung cancer staging was T4N3M1b.\n",
      "It was interesting to note that a separate mass was present in the right lung (c). He did have metastatic disease but this might represent a synchronous primary, although by strict definition, to diagnose this, we needed to prove that the second mass was of different histology to the primary mass or that it was of the same histology but with no mediastinal or metastatic spread [].\n",
      "While awaiting a bronchoscopy, the patient coughed up ∼600 mL of fresh blood in 12 h, with worsening hypoxia. Repeat full blood count and coagulation studies were normal.\n",
      "The patient was having massive haemoptysis, defined as coughing up anything between 100 mL and 600 mL of fresh blood in 24 h [].\n",
      "He was seen by the on-call medical team and sat upright. Two large-bore cannulae were inserted in case of exsanguination. Sitting upright runs the risk of the blood spilling over into the normal lung. “Drowning” by filling up the bronchial tree with blood tends to occur before any true haemodynamic instability due to volume loss. As such, the mainstay of treatment in massive haem­optysis is to protect the normal lung and try to stop the bleeding [, ].\n",
      "The respiratory team felt that a palliative approach was too premature, but it was explained to him that his prognosis was poor with limited treatment options available. He agreed to a “do not resuscitate” plan. A treatment escalation plan was agreed to ensure his treatment was limited to level 2 care. Hypoxia precluded a bronchoscopy or transfer to the local cardiothoracic centre. Bronchoscopic strategies to control pulmonary haemorrhage include balloon tamponade, iced saline lavage, administration of a topical vasoconstrictor or coagulant, laser therapy and electrocautery [].\n",
      "The patient pointed to his left hemithorax when asked which side he felt the bleeding was coming from. Anecdotal experience suggests that patients with haemoptysis can often accurately indicate the side of the bleeding lesion. He was therefore positioned on his left side and tranexamic acid was administered intravenously. A pilot study evaluating the effect of tranexamic acid and the related antifibrinolytic agent aminocaproic acid included three patients with haemoptysis due to lung cancer []. All three patients experienced cessation of bleeding within 1–4 days without any recurrence. Patients received 1.5 g of intravenous tranexamic acid initially, followed by 1 g three times per day for a week after cessation of bleeding. The use of tranexamic acid in bleeding has been recognised for a long time [] and tranexamic acid may reduce both the duration and volume of bleeding, with low risk of short-term thromboembolic complications [].\n",
      "His haemoptysis and hypoxia improved over the ensuing days, and at bronchoscopy an organised clot was visualised in the left upper lobe bronchus with no endobronchial masses and a normal right bronchial tree. Left upper lobe lavage revealed no malignant cells on cytology. At endobronchial ultrasound examination, a large paratracheal node was sampled and histology demonstrated a poorly differentiated necrotic squamous cell carcinoma.\n",
      "The patient’s clinical condition slowly improved until 15 days into his admission, when overnight he developed acute dyspnoea with tachycardia at 120 beats⋅min−1. Arterial blood gas sampling measured his arterial oxygen tension (PaO) at 7.0 kPa on high flow oxygen via a reservoir bag, and an arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO) of 5.1 kPa. A repeat chest radiograph showed no change.\n",
      "The PA–aO is a measure of the difference between the alveolar concentration (A) of oxygen and the arterial (a) concentration of oxygen. In room air (inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.21) at sea level (atmospheric pressure of 760 mmHg) assuming 100% humidity in the alveoli, a simplified version of the equation is 21−((PaCO/0.8)−PaO), 0.8 being the respiratory quotient.\n",
      "High flow oxygen delivers ∼85% oxygen, so 85−(5.1/0.8)−7=71.625, which is significantly raised. While his PA–aO was likely to be raised due to his cancer/effusion, such a disparity and the clinical picture points towards the possibility of a pulmonary embolus. The use of the PA–aO is a useful adjunct in diagnosis []. There are numerous case reports about tranexamic acid increasing the risk of pulmonary emboli [, ]. In this case, the patient had other significant risk factors such as disseminated malignancy and a prolonged period of immobility.\n",
      "The patient understood that if left untreated, a large pulmonary embolus may prove fatal, but by treating it with anticoagulation, a major fatal haemoptysis was also more likely. He agreed to receive LMWH together with morphine for symptoms of dyspnoea and agitation. 6 h later, he had improved clinically and was able to safely lie flat briefly for a CT pulmonary angiogram. This confirmed large right-sided pulmonary emboli with associated right heart strain with reflux of contrast into the venous circulation (). The option of inferior vena cava filter insertion to prevent further embolic events was not available in our hospital, and he was too unstable to be transferred to an appropriate tertiary hospital. Over the following 2 days, urgent palliative radiotherapy to the left-sided tumour was arranged. After he had received a single fraction, further large volume haemoptysis recurred. LMWH was stopped and tranexamic acid restarted. The bleeding settled once more and he completed five fractions of radiotherapy. Slowly his oxygen saturations improved to 93% on air and he was discharged home on long-term full-dose LMWH with no recurrence of the haem­optysis.\n",

Over the following 2 days, urgent palliative radiotherapy to the left-sided tumour was arranged. After he had received a single fraction, further large volume haemoptysis recurred. LMWH was stopped and tranexamic acid restarted. The bleeding settled once more and he completed five fractions of radiotherapy. Slowly his oxygen saturations improved to 93% on air and he was discharged home on long-term full-dose LMWH with no recurrence of the haem­optysis.\n",
      "He presented 3 weeks later with progressive respiratory failure and his symptoms were palliated according to his wishes.\n",

      "A 46-year-old woman was urgently presented to a nearby hospital because of a femur fracture caused by an accident. Although she was alert on arrival, she began to experience sleepiness approximately 5 hours later. A follow-up helical computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed the absence of any additional severe lesions or skull fractures. Chest CT confirmed an exudative lesion, and a pulmonary vascular computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed no obvious abnormalities. Based on the clinical and imaging findings, the patient was suspected to have CFE. After 2 days, the patient was moved to our neurology department to receive the appropriate care. Immediate physical examination on arrival revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 4, a positive bilateral Babinski sign, a positive Kernig sign, and neck stiffness. The patients left thigh presented bruising and swelling and had been fixed with external fixation with restrained movement in the previous hospital (Fig. A). She presented an arterial pressure of 148/80 mm Hg, heart rate of 124 bpm, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 64 mm Hg. Her blood gas analysis revealed a pH value of 7.4. Total body CT revealed a left femoral comminuted fracture with dislocation (Fig. B). Her bilateral lung presented an exudative lesion as well as pleural effusion (Fig. A). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed diffuse abnormal signals in the bilateral cerebral hemisphere, brainstem, and cerebellum, which were suggestive of embolization (Fig. ). Combined with the patients trauma history and imaging findings of the lung and brain, the patient was initially diagnosed with FES, whose corresponding treatment is mainly supportive. Regarding the closed fracture of the left femur, the external fixation that had been performed at the previous hospital was appropriate, and no further treatment was applied. Subsequent cardiovascular screening, including echocardiography, cervical artery ultrasound and bilateral lower extremity vascular ultrasound, was performed, and all the findings were negative. Four days after the femur fracture, the patient presented with moderate dyspnea, and her arterial blood gas analysis retrieved a pH value of 7.4. PO2 was 35 mm Hg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 126 mm Hg, and arterial oxygen saturation was 97.5% under nasal oxygen. Fourteen days after the fracture, both the lung symptoms and lung CT findings were considerably improved (Fig. B). Transthoracic echocardiography ultrasound was performed again, and shunts through a PFO were observed (Fig. ). On the following day, there was a gradual improvement in consciousness. However, the patients speech indicated dysphasia. Under active supportive care and hormone therapy, the patient was finally discharged with dysphasia and an untreated closed fracture.\n",

      "A 53-year-old man (height, 170 cm; weight, 89 kg) was admitted to the hospital because of a 1-year history of shortness of breath after exercise. The patient was a smoker, had a history of hypertension, and was taking captopril and nimodipine. Breathing was reduced in the left lung. However, neither rhonchus nor moist rales were heard during auscultation. Chest computed tomography revealed a GEB, and the left lung was compressed by about 95% with a right mediastinal shift (). An electrocardiogram showed normal findings, and echocardiography revealed that the heart was located in the right thoracic cavity. The left ventricular diastolic function was decreased, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was 64%. Laboratory tests showed no obvious abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis showed the following: pH: 7.43, PaCO2: 41 mmHg, PaO2: 94 mmHg, lactate: 1.4 mmol/L, potassium: 3.6 mmol/L, sodium: 138 mmol/L, calcium: 1.10 mmol/L, FiO2: 21%, and SpO2: 98%.\n",
      "On the day of surgery, the patient’s electrocardiogram, blood pressure, SpO2, and bispectral index were monitored upon entry into the operating room. A radial artery catheter and right internal jugular venous catheter were placed. The patient’s arterial blood pressure was 175/109 mmHg, heart rate was 90 beats/minute, and SpO2 was 94%. Before anesthesia, 40 µg of dexmedetomidine was infused within 10 minutes. The thoracic surgeon then created a small incision at the intersection of the sixth intercostal space and the left mid-axillary line to puncture the lung bulla and insert an indwelling catheter (14 Ga, 16 cm in length; Arrow International/Teleflex, Wayne, PA, USA) into the GEB to drain it for 15 minutes. The patient was preoxygenated with 100% oxygen at 6 L/minute for 5 minutes. Anesthesia was administered using 100 mg of propofol, 30 µg of sufentanil, and 50 mg of rocuronium. A 37-Fr right double-lumen endotracheal tube was inserted with the help of a visual laryngoscope, and single-lung ventilation was performed after proper alignment had been confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The tidal volume was set at 5 to 6 mL/kg, the respiratory rate was 15 to 17 breaths/minute, the positive end-expiratory pressure was set at 5 cmH2O, and the inhalation:expiration ratio was 1:2. Propofol, remifentanil, and sevoflurane were used to maintain anesthesia. The intraoperative bispectral index was maintained at 40 to 50. After resecting the GEB (), one-lung ventilation was switched to two-lung ventilation and the lungs slowly expanded with a low tidal volume until complete lung re-expansion was observed. During the 3-hour surgery, the patient experienced 50 mL of blood loss, was administered 1300 mL of lactated Ringer’s solution, and excreted 500 mL of urine. After the operation, the double-lumen endotracheal tube was replaced with a single-lumen endotracheal tube and the patient was sent to the intensive care unit for monitoring and further treatment. Two hours after entering the intensive care unit, the patient was fully awake and the tracheal tube was smoothly removed. The following day, the patient was transferred to the thoracic surgery ward, where he recovered; he was discharged 12 days later.

      "A 24-year-old man, a newly appointed automobile mechanic, presented to the emergency room of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital with a chief complaint of progressive shortness of breath, low-grade fever, bilateral chest pain, and nonproductive cough for three days. The shortness of breath was exertional, and the patient did not complain of any orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or pedal edema. The low-grade fever occurred three days before dyspnea, had a Tmax of 99.8°F, was on and off, and was not associated with chills or rigors. There was no history of wheezing, sputum production, hemoptysis, night sweats, weight loss, or anorexia. He denies any rash, joint pain, numbness, or weakness in the extremities. On detailed inquiry, he revealed that he recently started working as an automobile mechanic and had to aspirate diesel from fuel tanks often. As he was new to this job, he had accidentally aspirated a small volume of diesel several times in the last two weeks. He was a nonsmoker and had never consumed alcohol in his lifetime. The patient had no past medical history of note, no history of allergies, and had not taken any drugs or medications recently.\n",
      "On examination, he was ill-looking with a temperature of 98°F, a sphygmomanometric blood pressure of 140/90mmHg, a heart rate of 110 beats/minute, and a respiratory rate of 28/minute saturating poorly in ambient air (peripheral SpO2 87%, as measured by pulse oximetry). He had no pallor, icterus, lymphadenopathy, cyanosis, clubbing, edema, and dehydration. There was a decreased excursion of the chest wall on chest examination, diminished breath sounds bilaterally along with diffuse bilateral basal crepitations, and a dull stony percussion note bilaterally. The examination of other systems did not reveal any abnormalities. The patient had leukocytosis with a total WBC count of 13900/mm3, and differential leukocyte count consisted of 90% neutrophils and 10% lymphocytes. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count were normal. Renal function test, liver function test, coagulation assay, and serology tests were regular. Arterial blood gas analysis was within the reference range.\n",
      "Chest X-ray (CXR) done at admission (Figure ) showed pneumonic consolidation over the bilateral lung field with bilateral pleural effusion and pneumothorax. Chest tubes were inserted bilaterally under ultrasound guidance to alleviate pleural effusion and pneumothorax. On the second day of chest tube insertion, CXR (Figure ) was done again, revealing the left lung's expansion, persistent right-sided pneumothorax, and bilateral surgical emphysema. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of thorax revealed right-sided pneumothorax, bilateral pleural effusion, bilateral patchy consolidated lung parenchyma, and bilateral chest tube in situ.\n",
      "Owing to radiological findings, clinical features, and siphonage history, the diagnosis of hydrocarbon pneumonitis was made. Since Nepal is a tuberculosis endemic region, pulmonary tuberculous was also considered as alternative diagnosis. However, sputum examination did not reveal the acid-fast organism; neither did the GeneXpert PCR test. The patient was kept under intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam, nebulization was done six hourly, and high flow oxygen was administered. The patient developed no complications during his hospital stay. The patient was discharged after two weeks when there was significant radiological regression of consolidations (Figure ), improvements in pulmonary symptoms, and maintenance of oxygen saturation above 90% in room air.

      "A fit, physically active 32-year-old female with no underlying risk factors underwent a left knee anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and partial lateral meniscectomy. She was not taking oral contraceptives. She presented 19 days postoperatively with acute dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia, and complaints of feeling light-headed of 5 days duration. In the emergency department, she had sinus tachycardia on electrocardiography, a heart rate of 126 bpm, blood pressure of 107/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18/min, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Her examination was noted to be otherwise unremarkable. There was no evidence of surgical site infection and no limb swelling noted. A complete blood count and electrolyte and metabolic panel were normal. Her troponin was 80 ng/L (normal 0–14 ng/L). A chest radiograph and D-dimer were not performed. Her pretest probability of pulmonary embolism was moderate based on Wells' criteria [].\n",
      "Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) reported the patient as having PTE. Findings included saddle PE, extensive clot extending into lobar and segmental branches of all lobes () as well as evidence of right heart strain with marked right atrial (RA) and RV dilation as well as flattening and deviation of the interventricular septum. The RV/LV ratio was 1.3. Unfractionated low-molecular-weight heparin was immediately initiated. Her simplified PE Severity Index (sPESI) was 1 (high risk, 8.9% mortality) [].\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine service. On day 1, her clinical status was unchanged; laboratory indices were similar with a troponin level of 35 ng/L and NTpro-BNP of 3859 ng/L (normal 0–300). ICU was consulted on day 1 of admission, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was immediately requested. This demonstrated a 3.3 cm maximum diameter multilobulated, mobile right atrial thrombus, which extended from the RV inlet through the pulmonic valve to the pulmonary artery (i.e., an RHTT). Intraventricular septal flattening and severe RV dilation with moderate systolic dysfunction and tricuspid regurgitation were also observed. McConnell's sign was present with apical hypercontractility and basal and mid-ventricular segmental hypokinesis. The right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was 48.1 mmHg ().\n",

The case, as well as treatment options, was reviewed with a member of the pulmonary embolism response team (PERT). A decision was made to proceed with low-dose thrombolysis, despite the recent surgery, employing the regimen described in the MOPETT trial []. The potential benefits and risks were discussed with the patient who consented. She received a 10 mg recombinant tPA bolus followed by an additional 40 mg over two hours intravenously (IV).

      "A 39-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency room for the evaluation of jaundice. He complained of fever for the last seven days that was associated with nausea, intermittent headache, and dry cough. He also had diffuse arthralgia. The patient took over-the-counter antipyretic and analgesic but did not get any relief. The initial evaluation revealed a temperature of 100°F, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The physical examination showed severe jaundice with the icteric sclera. He had diffuse arthralgia with tenderness. Cardiac and chest examination was normal. The abdomen was soft with normal bowel sounds and no organomegaly.\n",
      "Initial laboratory analysis is shown in Tables and 2. The patient’s platelet count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were within the normal ranges, except white blood cells. His serum metabolic panel was unremarkable, except for elevated total bilirubin and creatinine.\n",
      "Extensive workup for severe jaundice involved serum iron studies, cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibody, and antinuclear antibody (ANA), all of which were negative. Common causes of hyperbilirubinemia such as hepatitis A, B, and, C were negative. His low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 50 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was 55 mg/dL, serum cholesterol was 180 mg/dL, and serum triglyceride was 152 mg/dL.\n",
      "On abdominal ultrasound, the liver, gall bladder, and spleen were normal in size and texture. CT of thorax and abdomen was performed, which revealed diffuse pulmonary and hilar infiltrates in both lung bases. It was suspected that the patient had a possible chest infection, and he was started on intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam. The patient’s kidney function was concerning due to high creatinine, but creatinine improved to 2.0 mg/dL on the third hospital day.\n",
      "On further investigation, the patient reported that he visited Connecticut, USA, one week ago. He had no history of tick bite. Peripheral smear examination of blood was performed, which revealed no abnormality in the morphology of blood cells. Serologic tests for Lyme disease were performed. He was treated with doxycycline at a dose of 100 mg twice a day on the third hospital day. The radiograph of the joints revealed no abnormality.\n",
      "His total bilirubin remained high during the hospital stay in the beginning, and his bilirubin was 12.0 mg/dL (direct: 10.3 mg/dL) on the third hospital day (Figure ). His white blood cell count remained elevated at 18 × 103/µL. However, his liver enzymes remained normal (Figure ).\n",
      "The patient’s fever resolved on hospital day 4, and joint pain also got better. Repeat ultrasound of the abdomen was conducted due to the worsening of laboratory results, which revealed no mass or calcification, except few changes in liver echotexture suggesting the possible fatty/fibrotic change. The gallbladder was thin-walled and anechoic, with no stones. Portal vein appeared red-orange, and the hepatic artery was yellow (indicating higher flow velocity). The decision was made for invasive workups such as biopsy and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), but the patient denied it.\n",
      "Serum ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) for Lyme disease was performed. The results of ELISA screen were positive for Lyme disease, which was further confirmed by Western blot.

      "The patient presented haemodynamically unstable, in grade 3 haemorrhagic shock and after resuscitation, improved as a transient fluid responder. A left-sided intercostal drain was inserted for a large haemothorax. Vital signs after resuscitation: heart rate 100; respiratory rate 14; saturating at 95% on room air; blood pressure 101/64. Post-resuscitation, no angina was reported. On examination: no features of cardiac failure, central cyanosis, bruits, or murmurs were elicited. No ST or other rhythm abnormalities were noted on electrocardiogram (). Pertinent findings were that of chronic septic hardware of the right lower limb which on further enquiry, had not been formally assessed by an orthopaedic service.

About 2 months ago, routine clinical examination by her oncologists revealed left axillary lymphadenopathy (2 × 3 cm) with fixed, firm and nontender node and an additional fixed mass (1 × 3 cm) in the anterior left forearm. Both lesions were excisionally biopsied. Further Imaging showed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and multiple metastatic lesions in the liver & abdomen and chest.

      "A 43-year-old man presented to the emergency department reporting sudden-onset feeling of palpitations and near syncope after strenuous heavy lifting. He was pale and diaphoretic; blood pressure was measured 90/70 mmHg, oxygen level 99%, heart-rate 210–230 b.p.m., and body temperature 36.6°C. Past medical history was clear for cardiac disease, syncope, or pre-syncope. No history of sudden cardiac death (SCD) or cardiomyopathy into his family was stated. He denied recent flu-like symptoms, smoking, illicit drug use, or excessive alcohol consumption. Physical examination was unremarkable. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) depicted an irregularly irregular, broad QRS complex tachycardia (). No previous ECG recordings were handed. Direct current (DC) cardioversion restored sinus rhythm with manifest ventricular pre-excitation and clear ‘delta’ waves () confirming our initial clinical suspicion for underlying WPW syndrome. Shortest pre-excited RR interval (SPERRI) during AF was estimated at 160 ms (), indicating an AP with extremely short antegrade effective refractory period (ERP) at risk for mediating SCD. Echocardiography ruled out abnormalities associated with WPW, including Ebstein’s anomaly, valve lesions, cardiac hypertrophy, atrial aneurysms, and septal defects. Cardiac ischaemia was also excluded on the basis of clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and laboratory data. The patient was put on enoxaparin 80 mg b.i.d. and propafenone 150 mg t.i.d. and his clinical course remained uneventful. Electrophysiological study (EPS) was performed at a tertiary centre on Day 10 post-diagnosis; programmed atrial stimulation induced pre-excited AF with markedly increased SPERRI = 264 ms and a left anterolateral AP with antegrade only conduction properties was ablated (). The patient was scheduled for routine cardiologic follow-up and advised to abstain from intense physical activity for at least 1-month post-discharge. In case of palpitations, ECG and 24-h Holter monitoring were suggested. CHA2DS2-VASc Score was calculated zero, so 1 month of rivaroxaban 20 mg daily was deemed sufficient post-ablation. Family members were also screened for pre-excitation. The patient remained symptom free without pre-excitation on surface ECG on his latest follow-up visit 3 months after the procedure.\n",

      "A 75-year-old woman, who was being treated with prednisolone 5 mg/day for polymyalgia rheumatica, presented with anorexia and general malaise for 3 days and then developed vomiting and diarrhea. She experienced difficulty moving her body, and her consciousness deteriorated. The patient was brought to our hospital on an ambulance. The consciousness level on admission, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation were E3V4M6, 39.5 °C, 153/88 mmHg, 124 beats/minute, 25 breaths/minute, and 90% (with oxygen mask 6 L/min), respectively. Her bulbar conjunctiva was congested on both sides, and coarse crackles were heard in the right lung field. Reticular dermatosis was found on both of her lower legs, and erythematous dermatosis was observed on the lower side of the back. Laboratory blood tests on admission showed elevated inflammatory markers (white blood cell count and C-reactive protein), creatine phosphokinase, and liver aminotransferase. Further, a rapid influenza diagnostic test was positive for influenza A (Table ). Chest computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse airspace opacification in the right middle lobe (Fig. ). Head CT demonstrated a slight fluid collection in the right upper sinus suggesting sinusitis.\n",
      "Her clinical signs and symptoms fulfilled three out of five clinical criteria of TSS with a fever of 38.9 °C or higher, diffuse erythroderma, and multisystem involvement (conjunctival congestion, gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, hepatic dysfunction, and disorientation). At this time point, she had not developed desquamation yet and had no hypotension. Therefore, the patient was clinically diagnosed with influenza with bacterial pneumonia and potential TSS, and her treatment was started with meropenem (1 g every 8 h), vancomycin (1 g every 12 h, therapeutic drug monitoring: ≥15 μg/mL), and clindamycin (600 mg every 8 h).\n",
      "The next day, S. simulans, a CoNS strain, was detected in both sets of blood cultures. Furthermore, pneumococci and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) were identified in sputum cultures (Geckler 4 group) and pharyngeal cultures (small number of colonies), respectively. Exotoxins, such as TSST-1, and staphylococcal enterotoxins (type A, B, C, and D), which are known to cause TSS, were not detected in culture samples of MSSA and S. simulans. We used the reversed passive latex agglutination method to evaluate the exotoxins and enterotoxins; the minimum detection sensitivity of sensitized latex using this method was found to be 1–2 ng/mL. We changed the antimicrobial therapy to cefazolin (1 g q8h) and clindamycin (600 mg q8h), based on microbiologic test results, and this therapy was administered for 14 days. Finger desquamation appeared on the 8th day of hospitalization, fulfilling four out of five clinical criteria for TSS. Therefore, we diagnosed the case as probable TSS.\n",
      "Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were high: neopterin 62 mmol/L (reference range, ≤5 mmol/L) and IL-6 38 pg/mL (reference range, ≤5 pg/mL). Lymphocyte subpopulation distribution was then analyzed in peripheral blood (Fig. ), showing prominent CD57 expression in CD8+ T cells, suggesting strong activation of this T lymphocyte subset.\n",
      "Furthermore, T cell receptor (TCR) Vβ repertoire distribution analysis was carried out (Fig. ). A specific subset of CD8+ T cells, including Vβ7.2 and Vβ14 cells, was increased, indicating the oligoclonal activation of CD8+ T cells likely due to antigen exposure.

      "An 88-years-old woman (height 146 cm, weight 50 kg) presented with complaints of low back and bilateral buttock pain as well as numbness in both lower extremities. The patient was suffering from a gait disorder which severely restricted her mobility without a wheelchair. A history of congestive heart failure and cerebral infarction was reported. The patient also had a 5-year history of lumbar nerve root and epidural blocks to manage her symptoms. MRI revealed multiple old compression fractures (T10–12, L2–4), vertebroplasty at T7, 10, 11, and L4 and spinal canal stenosis (severe central stenosis L1/2, bilateral mild foraminal stenosis T10–L1) (). On presentation, a fluoroscopy-guided epidural steroid injection was scheduled. In the prone position, the injection site was disinfected and 1% lidocaine was injected. The L5/S1 interspace was identified by fluoroscopy, and an 18-gauge Tuohy needle was advanced into the interlaminar space under an AP fluoroscopic view. The needle was advanced into the epidural space using the LOR technique with a 1-ml air-filled syringe though the LF and a location where the syringe would not rebound. However, CSF aspirated, and on injecting 0.5 ml of the contrast, a dural puncture was confirmed through the fluoroscopic AP and lateral images (). The procedure was aborted immediately. After explaining the occurrence of the dural puncture to the patient, she was sent to the recovery room. Her blood pressure was 103/61 mmHg, HR was 87 beats/min and oxygen saturation was 96%. Normal saline was infused intravenously and oxygen (5 L/min) was administered using a facial mask with a reservoir. One hour later, she complained of severe (NRS score 5–6) bilateral temporal headache and pain on the top of her head that persisted regardless of posture changes. Tramadol administration did not reduce her headache. A case of pneumocephalus was suspected. Brain CT examination showed the presence of air at the ventricular frontal horn, anterior interhemispheric fissure, right ambient cistern, and around bilateral cavernous sinuses (). The patient was admitted to the hospital after an explanation was provided to her and her guardian. After the admission, oxygen (5 L/min) was administered. Twenty-two hours later, the headache was reduced by 70%. Follow-up brain CT confirmed the reduction of the pneumocephalus. Therefore, she was discharged the next day. Follow-up 2 weeks after discharge, indicated complete resolution with no complaint of headache. Her physical examination was negative for pneumocephalus.\n",

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "Prior to COVID-19 vaccination becoming widely available, a previously healthy, 20-year-old Caucasian male with no significant past medical history presented with two weeks history of progressive dyspnea. About four days prior to presentation, he was evaluated at the emergency department with dyspnea, nonproductive cough, malaise, emesis, diarrhea, intermittent fever with a temperature max of 103°F, and found to have leukocytosis of 20,000 and negative COVID-19 test. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed bilateral interstitial patchy opacities and he was prescribed a five-day course of azithromycin for possible atypical pneumonia. He failed to improve after four days of treatment with azithromycin. He presented with worsening hypoxemia associated with fever, cough, emesis, and diarrhea.\n",
      "On presentation, vitals showed temperature of 100.8°F, heart rate 99, blood pressure 129/81, respiratory rate 40, SpO2 85% on room air which improved to >90% on 4L nasal cannula. The patient was not in respiratory distress and a physical exam showed crackles over right lung fields and left lingula with expiratory wheezes in the same distribution. Labs were significant for leukocytosis (18x10^3/uL) with eosinophilia (7%). CXR demonstrated diffuse bilateral airspace and interstitial opacity concerning for infection or inflammatory process including COVID-19 (Figure ). Azithromycin was continued and ceftriaxone was initiated for possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).\n",
      "The patient was placed in isolation for CXR findings, as mentioned above, which was concerning for COVID infection. Repeat testing for COVID came back negative. Further workup was significant for elevated ferritin 1,258 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 734 units/L, c-reactive protein (CRP) 27.20 mg/dL, procalcitonin 0.58 ng/mL suggestive of possible false-negative COVID-19 infection vs. CAP. Eosinophilic pneumonia vs. allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) was considered for eosinophilia and it was noted on initial complete blood count (CBC); further workup with IgE was unremarkable with 9.7 U/ml. Extensive infectious work up with influenza, mycoplasma, chlamydia nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), sputum culture, urine antigen testing for legionella, Histoplasma, blastomycosis, aspergillus all came back negative. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and QuantiFERON (QFT-G, Cellestis Limited, Carnegie, Vi Australia) were both negative.\n",
      "On further evaluation, the patient reported living in his parent’s basement around the time of dyspnea onset but denied being exposed to mold. He moved out to go to college within a few days of symptoms onset and he has been living with three housemates since then. The patient initially denied tobacco use, recreational drug use, or being sexually active, and later admitted to binge drinking and vaping (dapping, use of nicotine, and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products) once a week during social gatherings, and the last time he vaped was two days prior to the onset of dyspnea. The urine drug screen came back positive for cannabinoids.\n",
      "Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) acutely worsened while on empiric therapy for CAP requiring a high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with 35 to 45 L/min O2 and 0.4 to 0.6 FiO2, and he was started on treatment with methylprednisolone 40 mg every six hours and albuterol-ipratropium nebulizers. Infectious disease and pulmonology were consulted. Work up with CT chest demonstrated diffuse bilateral lower lobe predominant ground-glass opacities with relative sparing of the subpleural regions and associated interstitial thickening (Figure ). Suspicion of COVID infection remained high but he had a few more negative tests. An echocardiogram showed normal size lateral ventricles and normal systolic function with an ejection fraction of 63%; left pleural effusion was noted. AHRF improved significantly to 2L of nasal cannula after two days of receiving methylprednisolone. The patient was diagnosed with EVALI as a diagnosis of exclusion and AHRF resolved with steroid therapy.\n",
      "Infectious disease recommended discontinuing all antibiotics for low concern of infectious etiology. Pulmonology service recommended checking antinuclear antibodies (ANA), vasculitis panel with ANA, anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) for initial eosinophilia. All these labs were negative, and eosinophilia was later resolved. He underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy. Infectious work-up on the BAL sample was unremarkable for viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens and cytology demonstrated small clusters of atypical cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. The patient briefly required being on HFNC after bronchoscopy, but he was back on room air the third day after initiating methylprednisolone. Repeat CXR showed marked improvement in bilateral interstitial and soft tissue opacities (Figure ).\n",
      "The patient was hospitalized for a total of seven days, and he was discharged on prednisone 60 mg tapered dose over two weeks and supplementary oxygen (3 L of O2 with exertion). Five weeks after the hospital admission, the patient was evaluated at the pulmonary clinic for follow-up. He has been asymptomatic and AHRF has completely resolved.\n",

      "A 59-year-old female presented to the ED with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. Her abdominal pain began three hours before presentation and had awoken her from sleep. This abdominal pain was described as “achy,” 5/10, intermittent, and located in the left lower quadrant without radiation. She denied nausea or vomiting and had no diarrhea or blood in her stools. Review of systems revealed that the patient had symptoms of dysuria for one day and left-sided flank pain along with her abdominal pain. She denied fevers or chills. She stated that, despite taking her prescribed insulin injections, her blood sugars have been persistently elevated above 400 with her personal glucometer. Her past medical history was significant for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and prior cerebrovascular accident. She denied ever having any surgeries. She used regular insulin, Lantus (insulin glargine), and Ibuprofen. Her family history was noncontributory, and she denied alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use.\n",
      "Physical exam revealed a temperature of 36.5° C, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 166/81 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 99% on room air, and capillary blood glucose of 447 mg/dL. She was awake, alert, and interacting appropriately. Her pupils were equally round and reactive to light. The cardiac exam was normal and lungs were clear with breath sounds bilaterally. The abdomen was soft with minimal tenderness to palpation in the left periumbilical and left lower quadrant. There was no guarding or rebound. Extremities were warm and well-perfused. The neurological exam revealed no deficit.\n",
      "The metabolic panel revealed sodium of 132 mEq/L (normal 135–145), BUN of 45 mg/dL (normal 8–22), Creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL (normal 0.5–1.3), glucose of 473 mg/dL, and an anion gap of 8.0. A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/MM3 (normal 4.5–11.0) and a manual differential with 10.10 K/MM3 Neutrophils (normal 0.80–7.70). The hepatic panel was remarkable for an alkaline phosphatase of 189 U/L (normal 35–115). The urine was visibly clear and non-turbid. Urinalysis was leukocyte esterase and nitrate negative, but revealed large occult blood, glucosuria, protein of 300 mg/DL, and 3–6 WBC/HPF (normal 0–3).\n",
      "While laboratory studies were pending, the patient received one liter IV normal saline, four mg of morphine sulfate IV for pain, and 10 units of regular insulin. Despite fluid administration and analgesia, the patient continued to have worsening 6/10 abdominal pain. Given the patient’s presentation of undifferentiated abdominal pain without clear etiology and her immunocompromised state, a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was ordered. The CT scan revealed significant air in the bladder wall and lumen consistent with EC, severe left hydroureter and hydronephrosis without evidence of stones, and significant left perinephric stranding without gas in the renal parenchyma ().\n",
      "A gram of Ceftriaxone and 500 mg of Gentamycin were started empirically along with a repeat fluid bolus and placement of a Foley catheter. While awaiting consultation and admission to the Urology service, the patient complained of increased abdominal pain and was increasingly tender in the left lower quadrant and suprapubic region. Her heart rate was persistently tachycardic (in the 130s), and she developed a fever to 39.4°C. In light of developing urosepsis and the potential for rapid progression to Emphysematous pyelonephritis, Interventional Radiology (IR) was consulted and placed a left nephrostomy tube to relieve the functional obstruction of the urinary tract just eight hours after the patient presented to the ED. After nephrostomy tube placement by IR, the patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. The urine culture grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae and the patient was continued on IV antibiotics. Three days after admission, the nephrostomy tube was removed as the patient was able to void without use of a foley catheter and was able to control her pain. She was subsequently discharged and given a prescription for Levofloxacin 500 mg every day for fourteen days.\n",

      "A 43-year-old Brazilian man arrived at the ED in May 2020 with a history of cough with hemoptoic sputum for more than 1 month, evolving to mild respiratory distress in the last 7 days. He did not show signs of a fever and other symptoms. He had a previous history of HIV/AIDS with no adherence to antiretroviral therapy, illicit drug abuse, and had generalized anxiety disorder. He had lost clinical and laboratory follow-up in the last 5 years. In 2015, the HIV viral load was 9,054 copies/mm3, and the T-CD4 cell count was 407/mm3. On physical examination, his weight was 55 kg, heart rate was 79 bpm, respiratory rate was 18 rpm, and SPO2 was 96%. No lymphadenopathy was observed. Blood cell count presented low hemoglobin (9.9 g/dL) and hematocrit levels (29.7%), and normal platelet and white cell count ranges. Lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein levels were 312 U/L, above reference limits (140–271 U/L), and 52.3 mg/dL, respectively. The D-dimer level (0.6 mcg/mL) exceeded the normal range. Troponin, AST, ALT, and ferritin levels were in normal range.\n",
      "Chest CT revealed bilateral glass-ground opacities occupying approximately 25% of both lungs (). Respiratory secretion was collected with a nasopharyngeal swab and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA was detected using PCR (GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay) without RIF resistance. Treatment was initiated with azithromycin (500 mg/day), HCQ (400 mg/day) for 5 days, and ceftriaxone (2 g/day). He was treated with isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and RIF. Antiretroviral therapy was not started to avoid complications with anti-TB treatment. The patient was clinically stable and discharged to home after 1 week. Currently, the patient is under follow-up and remains asymptomatic without developing relapses.\n",

      "A 26-year-old female presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of dyspnea and left precordial pain of 6 hr duration. She had no history of exertional dyspnea, fever, weight loss, prolonged immobilization, syncope, focal neurological deficits, substance abuse, endocrine disorders and dermatological ailments in the past. She had no family history of cardiac disorders, including cardiac tumors. The patient's physical examination revealed blood pressure of 94/60 mmHg, heart rate of 120 beats/min, respiratory rate of 40/min, elevated jugular venous pressure with prominent ‘v’ wave. On cardiovascular system examination, S1 was normal, S2 was narrowly split with loud P2; a pan-systolic murmur of grade III/VI intensity was present along left sternal border. Tumor plop was audible. Chest was clear on auscultation. Abdominal examination was normal. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, right axis deviation and QR in V1 lead. Pulse oximetry revealed a saturation of 85% at room air increasing to 90% with 100% oxygen at 6 L/min. Laboratory examination revealed hemoglobin - 12.6 g/dl, total leukocytes count - 12.600/µL and platelet count of 1,00,000/µL. Liver function tests and renal function tests were normal. Chest roentgenogram was unremarkable.\n",
      "Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a large pedunculated mobile mass in RA with heterogenous echotexture attached to RA free wall and another mass attached to interatrial septum near fossa ovalis []. Another mass was seen in RV measuring 11 mm × 11 mm just beneath the septal leaflet of tricuspid valve []. Larger RA mass was prolapsing into RV producing severe eccentric TR jet with a gradient of 60 mmHg [, supplementary movie 1]. RV outflow tract and PA was dilated []. Inferior vena cava was free of any mass or thrombus (supplementary movie 2). HRCT thorax revealed embolization to the lateral aspect of right PA and along the medial aspect of left PA causing subtotal obstruction with pulmonary infarct in left lung [Figure and ]. Ultrasonography of abdomen and bilateral lower limb Doppler was unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen was normal.\n",
      "Once the diagnosis of multicentric RA and RV myxoma with tumor fragment embolization to PA was made, emergency surgery was performed by standard median sternotomy and cardio-pulmonary bypass using bicaval and ascending aortic cannulation to prevent further embolic events. Systemic hypothermia was used, and cardioplegia was administered for myocardial protection. The RA was then opened and a round lobulated mass measuring 3 cm × 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm was found attached to the RA free wall by a pedicle. Another mass attached to interatrial septum near fossa ovalis was excised. Multiple degenerating tumor strands were detected in RA, which were not visualized by transthoracic echocardiography. Another solitary mass was excised from the RV originating beneath the septal leaflet of tricuspid valve [Figure and ]. After the direct closure of RA, patient was weaned off the extra-corporeal circulation.\n",
      "Gross pathological examination revealed multiple flesh-colored soft to firm lobulated mass. Gross foci of degeneration were detected. Microscopy revealed hypocellular tumor tissue with myxoid background, isolated spindle and stellate cells with no abnormal mitosis or pleomorphism [Figure and ]. Gross pathology and histopathological examination were consistent with the diagnosis of cardiac myxoma.\n",

      "Mrs. A.O., a 40-year-old known SCD patient with hemoglobin SS genotype was referred to the pulmonary division on account of dry cough of 3 weeks, difficulty in breathing of 2 weeks, and bilateral leg swelling of 4 days. There was low-grade fever, no weight loss, and no contact with chronic cough index. Difficulty in breathing initially occurred on exertion but later occurred even at rest. There was orthopnea but no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. There was bilateral leg swelling, which worsened progressively. No swelling in other parts of the body. No reduction in her urine volume. She was not a diagnosed asthmatic, hypertensive, or diabetic and she was not previously treated for tuberculosis or any other chronic lung diseases. She was only admitted for childbirth in her adulthood years. She had a single episode of blood transfusion when she was 6 years old. Afterwards, she has been crisis free for more than 20 years. She neither smokes cigarettes nor consumes alcoholic drinks. No history of exposure to cigarette smoke from others. She is married in a monogamous family with two girls and one boy. Her last childbirth was 15 years prior to presentation. She works as a secretary in the registration office of a state polytechnic. No history of exposure to occupational dust or fumes. No history of chronic drug use and no history of allergy.\n",
      "On general examination, she was a middle aged looking woman, conscious, dyspneic with central cyanosis, afebrile (Temperature=36.5), not pale, anicteric, not dehydrated, grade 3 digital clubbing, bilateral pitting pedal edema up to the lower third of the leg, weight=84 kg, height=1.65 m, and BMI=30.9 kg/m2. Oxygen saturation in room air was 78% and this increased to 92% on 5 L/min of oxygen via nasal prong.\n",
      "Respiratory examination revealed that she was in respiratory distress as evidenced by respiratory rate of 42/ min, flaring of alae nasi, and use of accessory muscles of respiration, and the trachea was central with symmetrical chest movement. Percussion note was resonant with coarse crepitations over the entire right lung and posterior lower zone of the left lung.\n",
      "Cardiovascular examination: pulse=100 beats/min, regular with premature beats, full volume; arterial wall was not thickened. No locomotor brachialis. BP was 105/60 mmHg. JVP was raised to the angle of the jaw. She had a right parasternal heave and apex beat was in the 5th left intercostal just lateral to the mid-clavicular line. Heart sounds were S1, S2, S3 gallop rhythm with loud pulmonary component of second heart sound.\n",
      "Abdomen – full, moves with respiration, liver was 4 cm below the costal margin, mildly tender, smooth surface, and span of 16 cm. Spleen and kidneys were not enlarged. No demonstrable ascites.\n",

      "Her packed cell volume was 32% with a white blood cell count of 13.5 ×109/L (neutrophil=52%, lymphocyte=38%, other=9%) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 3 mm/h. Sputum examination for acid and alcohol fast bacilli was negative in three samples; sputum culture did not yield any growth. Chest X-ray showed widespread reticulonodular opacities involving the whole of the right lung field and left upper zone with an area of hyperluscency in the left mid and lower zones. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia of 120 beats/min, P pulmonale, and right ventricular hypertrophy with ventricular extrasystole. Echocardiography demonstrated tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary hypertension. Spirometry showed severe restrictive pattern {FVC=1.13 L (36% of predicted); FEV1=0.84 L (35% of predicted) FEV1/FVC ratio=74.5% (92% of predicted)}. Chest CT demonstrated diffuse ground glass opacity with thickening of interlobar septa in the entire right lung field as well as left apex and part of the left lower region.

      "A 64-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 10-day history of fatigue, shortness of breath, and peripheral oedema.\n",
      "His medical history included: bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, 5 months prior, for critical aortic stenosis and significant coronary artery disease, hypertension, type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolaemia, nephrotic syndrome, and pulmonary embolism. He was an active gentleman, often completing several rounds of golf per week.\n",
      "Medications included: warfarin, clopidogrel 75 mg OD, losartan 25 mg OD, atorvastatin 20 mg OD, prednisolone 60 mg OD, gliclazide 240 mg/40 mg BD, and linagliptin 5 mg OD.\n",
      "At presentation, his blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg, heart rate 72 b.p.m., respiratory rate 25 b.p.m., oxygen saturations 100% on air, and he had a temperature of 37.7°C. On physical examination, he appeared breathless on minimal exertion, had fine right basal crepitations, a pan-systolic and early diastolic murmur, and bilateral mild pitting oedema. Initial laboratory investigations revealed a haemoglobin of 117 g/L, white cell count of 11.57 × 109/L (neutrophil count 9.26 × 109/L), C-reactive protein 11 mg/L, and creatinine 96 μmol/L [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 72 mL/min].\n",
      "The primary components of the admission differential diagnosis included: infective endocarditis, aortic valve dehiscence or thrombosis, congestive cardiac failure of alternative cause, and pneumonia.\n",
      "Urgent echocardiography was performed which demonstrated dehiscence of the aortic valve with mild aortic regurgitation. On 2D echo imaging, a hypoechoic tract could be visualized from the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) to the RA (Figure ). The suspicion of a Gerbode defect was confirmed on colour flow mapping, with a large jet demonstrated between the two chambers (Figure and C).\n",
      "Computerized tomography (CT) revealed a complex aortic root pseudoaneurysm with LVOT to RA fistulation and a large left-to-right shunt (Figure and B).\n",
      "Three peripheral blood cultures taken on admission returned positive for Staphylococcus warneri, a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Treatment with intravenous gentamicin, vancomycin, and rifampicin was initiated and after 10 days of therapy, he underwent a surgical aortic valve replacement and LV–RA fistula repair. After 1 month in hospital, he was discharged home, and 2 months later was back on the golf-course, albeit with a very limited swing on account of his recent sternotomy.\n",

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "Our patient is an otherwise previously healthy, active, nonsmoking, 40-year-old male who presented to an outside hospital on April 2, 2020, with a 7-day history of fevers (Tmax: 102.7°F, 39.3C) and worsening shortness of breath. On presentation, he was saturating 80% on room air, which improved to 96% with 6 l of the nasal cannula. His other vitals at presentation included: heart rate of 87 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, the temperature of 39.1C, and blood pressure of 135/60 mmHg. His height was 188 cm, weight 87.7 kg, and body mass index was 25. His C-reactive protein (CRP) was 19.8 mg/dL (normal: 0.3–1.0 mg/dL). Other admission laboratories included a point of care troponin (normal, 0.0 ng/ml), creatinine of 1.17 mg/dL, carbon dioxide of 27 mmol/L, procalcitonin of 0.31 ng/ml, lactic acid of 1.5 mmol/L, normal liver transaminases, normal prothrombin time, white blood cell count (8.9 10^9/L) and differential, hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL. No D-Dimer or brain natriuretic peptide testing was performed and per the initial assessment, since there were no complaints of leg swelling, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was not performed, however, a chest X-ray demonstrated “multi-focal consolidation most consistent with typical viral bronchopneumonia” []. No other source of bacterial infection or cause of acute respiratory failure was identified, and a COVID polymerase chain reaction test was positive. He required mechanical ventilation (initial setting: rate: 24/min; positive end-expiratory pressure: 14 mmHg; peak inspiratory pressure: 31 mmHg; tidal volume: 460 ml; FIO2: 0.70) the following day with a CRP of 23.6 mg/dL and a ferritin of 1039 ng/mL (normal: 38–380 ng/mL). His COVID-19 therapies are listed in . D-Dimer testing on April 9th was elevated to 5.25 mg/L.\n",
      "However, due to the worsening of his respiratory failure, including poor response to prone positioning and inhaled nitric oxide (40 parts/million), he was transferred to our institution for ECMO on April 7, 2020 []. On arrival, he was immediately assessed by our ECMO Team (respiratory ECMO survival prediction score: 3, Class II risk, 76% predicted survival)[] and placed on percutaneous veno-veno ECMO at the bedside (21 Fr single-stage inflow, 25 Fr multi-stage drainage cannulas with Maquet CardioHelp circuit (Maquet Cardiovascular, Wayne NJ USA). ECMO was initiated 96 h postinitiation of mechanical ventilation. At the time of cannulation, his arterial PaO2 to FiO2 (P/F) ratio was 45. He was treated with tocilizumab on April 11, and the following day, an additional unit of convalescent plasma was given. Neither he did receive remdesivir, nor did he receive steroids. Systemic heparin for the ECMO circuit was used with a target partial thromboplastin time of 40–60 s. A lung-protective strategy was employed using an airway pressure release ventilation mode that was frequently adjusted to minimize airway pressures and atelectasis.\n",
      "He was successfully decannulated on April 15, 2020 (189 h on ECMO) and was extubated to the nasal cannula by April 17 with a P/F ratio of 213.\n",
      "He was discharged home with his family on April 21, 2020, on room air []. His COVID-19 test (Cepheid Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay) on the day before discharge was still positive, and he was advised to self-isolate. His only medication at discharge was apixaban 5 mg po BID for a peroneal deep-vein thrombosis discovered post-ECMO.\n",
      "Formal pulmonary function testing was obtained on May 6, 2020 [] and reported no abnormalities. The final interpretation was: “no evidence of obstruction, restriction, or diffusion impairment.” Outpatient COVID-19 testing was negative. The patient reported no respiratory symptoms, was walking and eventually running at least 6 miles a day and was encouraged to pursue more intensive exercise as tolerated (of note, the patient was an avid marathon runner before his illness). As he has been doing well, not further chest imaging has been performed. Although no family member tested positive for the disease, his wife tested positive for antibodies, suggesting she had been infected previously. However, she never required hospitalization or treatment and never manifested significant clinical signs or symptoms.\n",

      "The patient was a 52-year-old man who referred to the Poursina Hospital in Rasht while complaining of abdominal pain from the day before hospitalization. The patient reported a history of tiredness, fever, and nausea. In the examinations performed, there was a brief tenderness in the patient’s epigastrium. The patient’s initial pressure was 80.120 with a pulse rate of 95. The patient’s fever was not detected upon arrival. For the patient, an upright abdominal radiograph, abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds, and blood tests including CBC,BUN,Cr,PT,PTT,INR,LFT,Amylase,Lipase,LDH were requested.\n",
      "The patient’s upright abdominal radiograph was normal. Perihepatic and perisplenic fluid and gallstones were seen on the patient’s ultrasound. On laboratory findings, White Blood Cells (WBC) = 4000 /μL with 30% lymphocytes were reported. Hemoglobin (Hb) = 11 g/dL and Platelets (PLT) = 245,000 /μL were found. Other findings were normal. No pathological lesion was observed on the patient’s lung CT scan (Fig. ). A small amount of perihepatic and perisplenic fluid was observed on the patient’s CT scan (Fig. ).\n",
      "The patient was monitored and about 12 h after hospitalization, ill appearance, respiratory (respiratory distress) symptoms, and high fever were reported for the patient. The patient’s O2Sat was 96%. Due to the exacerbation of the patient’s respiratory symptoms, the CT scan of the lungs was requested again for the patient and the tests were repeated for suspicion of coronavirus.\n",
      "The second CT scan was performed about 18 h after the initial examination. Patchy ground-glass lesions along with bilateral pleural effusion were seen on the CT scan of the patient’s lungs (Fig. ). A bilateral chest tube was inserted for the patient according to the volume of the fluid, and according to the patient’s CT scan and respiratory symptoms, he was transferred to the specialized COVID-19 unit. In the new blood tests, Hb = 9.5 g/dL, WBC = 4800/μL, and PLT = 195,000 /μL were observed. An extensive fluid collection around the spleen was observed on the CT scan performed for the patient (Fig. ). The examination of the patient’s abdomen changed significantly about 20 h after the initial examination and became generalized rebound tenderness. However, the patient’s blood pressure was still 70.110 and the pulse rate was 90. According to the examination, the patient was immediately transferred to the operating room and underwent laparotomy. During the operation, contrary to our expectations, a lot of blood (about 1000 cc) was observed in the patient’s abdomen. After blood suctioning, the left upper quadrant was bleeding and the rupture of the spleen could also be observed. Therefore, a splenectomy was performed (Fig. ).\n",
      "In the examinations performed for the patient, the patient’s PCR confirmed COVID-19. The patient was admitted to the ICU after surgery, and within 3 days after surgery, the patient was extubated. The patient’s chest tubes were removed within 1 week after the surgery according to the radiographs performed. After a concomitant treatment for COVID-19 and during a two-week hospital stay, the patient was discharged in good general condition.\n",
      "During the examinations performed and the history taken several times from the patient and the patient’s companion, no history of the trauma was given and the changes in the patient’s CT scan and the patient’s examinations occurred very quickly.\n",
      "The LE cell, ANA, and HIV as well as the Monospot, RF and Wright agglutination test were negative. The peripheral blood smear and the Widal agglutination test were negative for malaria and VCA Antibody IgM and IgG were negative for Epstein - Barr virus (EBV).\n",
      "In the macroscopic study of splenic pathology, a spleen tissue with dimensions of 11× 8 × 5 cm and a weight of 350 g and a laceration with a size of 2 × 2 cm were observed and in the microscopic study, a focally hemorrhagic area was reported.\n",

      "A 44-year-old Hispanic woman presented to the hospital with a six-month history of generalized weakness, weight loss of 40 pounds over a four-month period and a two-week history of progressively worsening dyspnea. She had had hypertension for five years for which she was being treated with lisinopril but had been noncompliant for over three years because of financial constraints. The patient denied any alcohol or illicit drug use and was a lifelong non-smoker.\n",
      "On admission, her blood pressure was 102/66 mm/Hg, her temperature was 37°C, her respiratory rate was 24 breaths/minute, her oxygen saturation level was 92% on room air and her pulse rate was 88 beats/minute. A physical examination revealed an ill-looking woman with mucosal pallor, generalized wasting and non-tender, rubbery axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. There was no evidence of cyanosis, digital clubbing, pitting edema, skin rash or joint deformities. Her abdomen was mildly distended but non-tender, with no organomegaly detected. Dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left base were noted on the respiratory system examination. The cardiovascular and neurological examinations were unremarkable.\n",
      "Initial laboratory investigations (Table ) revealed anemia, leukopenia, elevated blood urea nitrogen and elevated serum creatinine. Urinalysis showed trace proteinuria. Chest radiography revealed bilateral pleural effusions that were determined to be exudative in nature on the basis of thoracocentesis. There was a high index of suspicion for malignancy; however, the results of chest, abdomen and pelvis computed tomography scans and an axillary lymph node biopsy did not confirm this. Human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculin skin tests were negative.\n",
      "On day four of admission, she developed acute inflammatory arthritis of the elbows and knees. A serological workup revealed high anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody and anti-Smith antibody titers, with low complement 3 levels. An active sediment was noted on the basis of urinalysis (Table ). The patient's renal impairment persisted, and her glomerular filtration rate was estimated to be 53 ml/min/1.73 m2. A review of blood results since admission showed evidence of documented leukopenia on more than two occasions.\n",
      "On day 5 of admission, the patient experienced dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. Reaccumulated pleural effusions were noted on a chest radiograph, and an echocardiogram showed evidence of pericardial effusion. Arterial blood gas interpreted in conjunction with a corresponding basal metabolic panel (Table ) revealed the presence of a non-anion gap hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis consistent with type 4 RTA. Analysis of morning serum sample showed a serum aldosterone level less than 1 ng/dl.\n",
      "The renal ultrasound obtained showed normal kidney morphology and no evidence of nephrolithiasis. A renal biopsy was done, which revealed diffuse global proliferative and membranous glomerulonephritis. This was consistent with lupus nephritis Renal Pathology Society/International Society of Nephrology 2003 class IV-G(A) and V, moderate activity index 9/24, minimal chronicity index 1/12; minimal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and acute tubular necrosis (Figure ).\n",

The patient was subsequently restarted on Rivaroxaban® and discharged. He presented again 5 days later with left arm weakness and was found to have multiple areas of punctuate infarctions of both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, more confluent within the right frontal lobe on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain ( and ). He has been compliant with his Rivaroxaban® since the previous hospital discharge 5 days prior. The patient was admitted and subsequently started on unfractionated heparin. On admission, his vital signs were blood pressure 138/93, heart rate 65 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed regular rate and rhythm, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops and clear lungs on auscultation. Neurologic examination revealed intact cranial nerves, preserved strength in all extremities with an exception of mild dysmetria in the left upper extremity and an NIH score of 1. Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, non-specific ST changes, and a premature ventricular contraction. Transthoracic echocardiogram was notable for normal left ventricular function with mild tricuspid regurgitation and stage 1 diastolic dysfunction. Transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for intracardiac thrombus. The echocardiography with agitated saline contrast revealed microbubbles of moderate opacity entering the left atrium from the left lower pulmonary vein indicative of a grade 2 intra-pulmonary arteriovenous shunt (). There was no atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale. Unfractionated heparin was continued, and the patient was transferred to a tertiary care center for embolization of the shunt. There, he developed recurrent cerebral infarctions while anticoagulation was temporarily held. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was done for persistent abdominal pain, and noted an omental mass, and subsequent exploratory laparotomy revealed an adenocarcinoma within the omentum with nodular peritoneal implants.

The minocycline was discontinued, and she was treated with 30 milligrams (mg) daily oral prednisone with improvement of the rash. Initial vitals included blood pressure of 81/68 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), heart rate of 121 beats per minute (bpm), and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. She was afebrile (36.7ºC oral temperature) and had pulse oximetry (SpO2) of 100% on room air. Physical exam was within normal limits. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed right bundle branch block and normal ST-T segments, but no previous ECG was available.\n",
      "While in the ED the patient had an episode of syncope during peripheral venous catheter placement, and intravenous (IV) fluids were administered due to concern of vasovagal event. She was also administered 5 mg IV dexamethasone due to possibility of adrenal suppression from steroid use. Her systolic pressure improved. However, the patient complained of worsening chest pain and then became unresponsive with pulseless electrical activity arrest (PEA). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and Advanced Cardiac Life Support were initiated. She received two doses of 1 mg IV epinephrine with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in normal sinus rhythm of 70 bpm and blood pressure of 72/48 mmHg. Due to persistent hypotension, norepinephrine infusion was administered with improvement of blood pressure to 88/56 mmHg. She was intubated for airway protection.\n",
      "Due to concern for massive pulmonary embolus, computed tomography chest angiography was performed but was unremarkable. Point-of-care echocardiogram demonstrated no right heart strain and grossly reduced heart function. Telemetry demonstrated QRS widening and increasing bradycardia to 41 bpm. The patient then developed a second PEA arrest with ROSC after CPR and one dose of 1 mg IV epinephrine. She remained hypotensive with blood pressure of 60/40 mmHg despite norepinephrine infusion. Initial troponin-T measured was 8.56 nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL) (reference range 0.0–0.02 ng/mL) and complete blood count with differential showed leukocytosis of 17.5 × 103 cells/mL (reference range 4.0–10.0 × 103 cells/mL) and eosinophilia of 1.6 × 103 cells/mL r (reference range 0.0–0.4 × 103 cells/mL). The cardiology service was consulted and a formal echocardiogram demonstrated a severely reduced ejection fraction of 15% (normal range 55–70%).\n",
      "The dermatology service was also consulted at bedside in the ED; concern for ANEM in setting of DRESS given the rapidity of onset of her cardiac dysfunction was discussed. Also, the differential diagnoses included coronary vasculitis, viral myocarditis, infiltrative cardiomyopathy, and sepsis. (She was administered 4.5 g piperacillin/tazobactam and 20 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) vancomycin, and 500 mg azithromycin IV.)\n",
      "While in the ED the patient developed further hypotension with blood pressure of 61/40 mmHg despite multiple vasopressors (IV vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions) and had severe acidemia and hypoxemia despite high ventilator support. Ventilator settings were tidal volume of 360mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 20 centimeters of water (cmH2O), and fraction of inspired oxygen of 100%, and respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. Arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed respiratory acidosis with pH of 7.06, carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) of 78 mmHg (reference range 33–43 mmHg), low arterial oxygen (PaO2) of 61 mmHg (reference range 80–100 mmHg), and normal bicarbonate. Basal metabolic panel was within normal limits. Due to continued decline, she received cannulation for veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) within the ED. ECMO cannulation occurred within three hours of initial cardiac arrest. Once placed on ECMO she had significant improvement in her acidosis and hypoxemia on repeat ABG (pH 7.39, pCO2 41 mmHg, PaO2 135 mmHg) and was rapidly weaned from her vasopressors.\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) for further management. Due to concern of DRESS-induced myocarditis, dexamethasone with a dose of 1 mg/kg/day was administered intravenously. On hospital day (HD) eight, cardiac biopsy demonstrated diffuse active myocarditis with coagulative myocyte necrosis and mixed infiltrate including eosinophils consistent with DRESS myocarditis. She was decannulated from ECMO on HD 16. She was eventually discharged after 20 days in the ICU and 62 total days in the hospital with a life vest and continued cardiac follow-up. An echocardiogram performed three months later demonstrated improved ejection fraction of 34%.\n",

      "A 79-year-old African American female presented to the emergency room for shortness of breath with exertion and grade 2+ bilateral lower limb edema. The patient denied dizziness, palpitation, fever, chills, productive cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, melena, and hematochezia.\n",
      "On examination, the patient's blood pressure was 94/66 mmHg, the temperature was 97.6 °F, the heart rate was irregular with a rate of 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and she was saturating 100% on room air. Sinus pauses were noted, up to 10 seconds in length, on the telemetry monitor. ECG and telemetry monitoring demonstrated SSS with sinus bradycardia, pauses up to three seconds, and atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rate of 130 beats per minute (bpm; Figure ). Her other medical history included paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, lower extremity venous insufficiency, diastolic heart failure (ejection fraction of 70-75%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, and no other medical history reported. The patient's home medications included fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhaler, albuterol sulfate inhaler, torsemide, metolazone, potassium chloride, vitamin D3, pantoprazole, sotalol, and no other heart rate modulating medication reported. Laboratory workup revealed a potassium of 4.5 (3.5-5.1 mM/L), magnesium of 2.3 (1.7-2.7 mg/dL), thyroid-stimulating hormone of 1.54 (0.34-5.60 µIU/mL), and troponin of 0.1 (0.0-0.5 ng/mL). The patient underwent urgent pacemaker placement to prevent further sinus pauses.\n",
      "The patient was also complaining of dysphagia and difficulty swallowing, for which an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed. The procedure identified both esophageal and duodenal ulcers. The biopsy was performed during the EGD and sent for histopathological review. The esophagus contained small columnar pieces of mucosa and collections of eosinophilic, amorphous material demonstrated on congo red staining. The congo red stain contained one fragment with blood vessels that exhibited mural deposition of amyloid. In the duodenal biopsy, the lamina propria also had amyloid on congo red staining. Videofluoroscopic swallowing examination revealed no tracheal aspiration and no motility disorder. Eventually, the patient required percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement for feeding secondary to dysphagia. TTE findings were consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy, raising the possibility of cardiomyopathy secondary to amyloidosis and SSS as the initial presenting feature in our patient.\n",
      "The patient had also developed a bifascicular block, which was potentially consistent with an infiltrative amyloid disease. The patient had a Kappa free light chain drawn, and this was markedly elevated at 146 mg/dL (reference range 0.3-1.9 mg/dL), Lambda 1.97 (0.5-2.6 mg/dL), with a Kappa/Lambda ratio of 74.1. We performed electrophoresis to investigate further and found an elevated gamma globulin of 1.75 g/dL (reference range 0.70-1.50 mg/dL).\n",
      "Two months later the patient presented with persistent, progressive shortness of breath on minimal exertion and persistent lower limb edema. Laboratory work-up was significant for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 838 (2-100 pg/mL), BUN of 37, creatinine of 1.85, white blood cell count of 10.3 (4.5-11.0 × 103/µL), hemoglobin of 10.7 (12.0-15.7 g/dl), and platelet count of 178 (140-440 × 103/µL). ECG was obtained and demonstrated an atrial paced rhythm, bifascicular block, left anterior fascicular block, right bundle branch block, and a pronounced low voltage pattern throughout all leads (Figure ). She had three negative troponins, and her pacemaker was found to be functioning appropriately. The patient did not have any compelling cardiac symptoms aside from the dyspnea on exertion.\n",
      "TTE demonstrated an ejection fraction of 60%, a small pericardial effusion, an increased left ventricular wall thickness (left ventricular posterior wall diastolic thickness 1.4 cm (0.6-1.0/0.6-0.9 cm), right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) 56 mmHg, and mild to moderate biatrial enlargement (Figure ).\n",
      "A renal biopsy and bone marrow biopsy were performed to confirm the diagnosis of amyloidosis. The results of these biopsies were consistent with our hypothesis that the patient had AL amyloid.

      "A 57-year-old woman presented to the rheumatology clinic with recurrent fever and painful ulcers on her legs since two months. Eight months prior to current presentation, she developed vertigo and decreased hearing in her left ear which she felt was “full of air” all the time. She was found to have sensorineural deafness in her left ear. Two weeks later, she developed fever with chills. A chest radiograph revealed infiltrates in her right lung and an elevated ESR. She was treated with oral antibiotics which relieved her symptoms. Then she developed gingival hypertrophy and a CT scan of the paranasal sinuses revealed subcutaneous soft tissue thickening of the right buccal area suggestive of an inflammatory process. She was treated with ibuprofen and felt better. Her past medical history was notable for hypothyroidism for 20 years and she as well was maintained on 50 mcg of thyroxin daily. She had undergone hysterectomy for uterine fibroids 15 years ago. She reported no recent travel history. Of note, she revealed contact with sick animals. She nursed her paralyzed pet dog and also had cats. She was treated with antibiotics yet continued to spike fever and came to our center for comprehensive evaluation. On examination, she appeared weak and ill. The temperature was 37.5°C, the blood pressure 139/69 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, with 99% oxygen saturation at room air. Erythematous tender nodules were noticed on bilateral lower extremities ().\n",
      "The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Her complete blood count revealed normocytic, normochromic anemia with normal white cell and platelet count. Her biochemistry showed normal kidney and liver function. No active sediment was present on urinalysis. Her three sets of blood cultures and one urine culture reported no growth. The test for latent tuberculosis by interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) was also negative. Serology for Brucella abortus and melitensis also came negative. Tests for chronic viral hepatitis B and C were also normal. Serological tests for connective tissue disease were negative as was the serum angiotensin converting enzyme level. Other relevant investigations are outlined in . An upper abdominal ultrasound showed hypoechoic, cystic lesions scattered across both lobes of the liver (). A subsequent CT scan of the abdomen with contrast showed multiple oval hypoattenuating lesions in both lobes of the liver ().\n",
      "On liver biopsy there was evidence of cholestasis and multiple large irregular areas of necrosis, palisaded by epitheloid cells with associated granulomatous inflammation with a number of plasma cells ().\n",
      "Acid-fast bacilli culture of liver biopsy specimen after six weeks came out negative. Meanwhile, the patient continued to spike fever with maximum temperature of 101°F. Leg lesions were becoming worse with central necrosis and purulent discharge (Figures and ).\n",
      "Pus cultures were negative for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial growth. A biopsy of the skin was performed. Pathological examination of frozen sections revealed surface ulceration with fibrinoid necrosis and vasculitis involving superficial and deep dermal vessels along with granuloma formation, neutrophilic infiltration, and debris ().\n",
      "Immunohistochemical testing was performed on biopsy specimen using immune-alkaline phosphatase technique which came negative for mycobacterial species. Real-time PCR for mycobacterial species also turned out to be negative. It was concluded from the skin biopsy that the patient had cutaneous granulomatous vasculitis. Treatment was commenced with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day and the patient was offered induction with cyclophosphamide which she refused due to associated toxicities. Meanwhile, azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day was added to prednisone. After seven weeks on prednisone and six weeks of azathioprine her lesions had healed almost completely (). She was maintained on prednisone 5 mg bid and azathioprine 50 mg bid with healing lesions. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen revealed normal architecture of hepatic parenchyma.\n",
      "Therefore, considering a chronic inflammatory process characterized by hearing loss, gingival hypertrophy, granulomatous hepatic lesions, and cutaneous ulcers with necrotizing granulomatous inflammation on skin biopsy, a unifying diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) was made.\n",

      "A 55-year-old man with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and depression developed pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath, and had a syncopal episode during a car trip from Texas to Cleveland. In the emergency room (ER), his blood pressure was 120/83 mmHg, pulse 119/min, respiratory rate 22/min, temperature 36.6oC, and oxygen (O2) saturation was 93% on room air. Physical exam was notable for an obese male in no acute distress with tachycardia, regular rhythm, clear lungs, shallow breaths without accessory muscle usage, and mild epigastric tenderness. His electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 117 bpm with a deep S wave in lead I, a small Q wave and inverted T wave in lead III (Figure ).\n",
      "Initial laboratory testing was significant for serum sodium 132 mmol/L, creatinine 1.6 mg/dL, ProBNP 3188pg/mL, and initial troponin 0.12, peaking at 0.2 on hospital day two. Computed tomography (CT) chest showed bilateral submassive pulmonary emboli in multiple branches of the right and left upper and lower lobe pulmonary arteries, with no indication of a saddle embolus or main pulmonary artery thrombus (Figures -).\n",
      "The patient was started on an intravenous (IV) heparin drip and thrombolytics were deferred due to perceived hemodynamic stability and timing of presentation. While in the ER, he became more tachycardic with heart rate 130-140 bpm, and developed jugular venous distention and acute hypoxemia requiring 3 liters (L) nasal cannula to maintain normal O2 saturation. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to possible signs of acute decompensation.\n",
      "In the MICU, ultrasound revealed a right popliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT); an inferior vena cava filter was considered, but the patient was considered hemodynamically stable and placement of a filter was deferred. Over the second and third hospital days, he remained tachycardic at 105-130/min with blood pressures in the 110/80 mmHg range and stable O2 saturations on 3L per nasal cannula. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed right ventricular strain and a mobile structure in the right atrium, possibly consistent with thrombus. On hospital day four, he remained hemodynamically stable but experienced mild pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. On hospital day five, the patient was switched from IV heparin to enoxaparin 120 mg twice daily with a two-hour overlap; he was noted to have a transient O2 desaturation but remained normotensive. In the early hours of day six, he became diaphoretic and developed sustained tachycardia at 140/min with a blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg. He then developed chest pain and worsening dyspnea and lethargy, and was found to be in atrial flutter with 2:1 block. In the early afternoon, while speaking with the medical team and later while working with physical therapy, the patient complained of worsening shortness of breath, and was noted to be diaphoretic and persistently tachycardic at 120/min. Shortly thereafter, he lost consciousness and was found to be in cardiac arrest.

Also, she has a history of opioid abuse. She takes metformin 1000 mg and aspirin 81 mg. She has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 22 years. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 155/80 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate 31/min, and temperature 37.9℃ (100.2℉). Blood saturation on room air is 89%. On examination, the patient is dyspneic and acrocyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral rales over the lower lobes. A cardiac examination is significant for S2 accentuation best heard in the second intercostal space at the left sternal border and S3 presence. There is no leg edema. Neurological examination is within normal limits.\n",

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 42-year-old African American female who recently emigrated from the Caribbean Islands initially presented with non-resolving productive cough and dyspnea for two weeks. She had no significant past medical history, no history of medication use, no history of surgery, or recent prolonged immobilization. Admission vitals were: blood pressure (BP) 110/75, temperature 98.2 F, respiratory rate 18/min, sPO2 95% room air, tachycardia with 110-120 beats/min. She was anxious on presentation. Rest of the physical exam including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory system findings, were unremarkable.\n",
      "Initial investigations revealed the following: White blood cell count 9.9 x 109/L (ref 4-11 x 109/L), hemoglobin 11.7 gm/dl (reference 13-15 gm/dl), hematocrit 36.8% (reference range 39-48%), platelets 304,000/ml (reference 15,000 to 450,000/ml); arterial blood gas analysis suggested hypoxia, pO2 being 72% and had high A-a gradient of 37 mm Hg (normal 5-10 mm Hg); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated to 508 unit/L (reference range 140-280 units/L). Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia. CT angiogram chest did not show any pulmonary embolus but showed diffuse ground glass lung opacities with hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure ). She underwent voluntary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing as per New York State law, and the test came back reactive with CD4 count 46 cells/micro litre (reference range 500-1500 cells/micro litre) and HIV viral load 810231 copies/ml (reference range 40-50 copies/ml). The urine legionella antigen was negative. Treatment was initiated with oral Bactrim DS and Prednisone (for suspected Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia [PCP]), and further investigation by bronchoscopy specimen was positive for Pneumocystis carinii PCR confirming PCP. The patient improved clinically and was discharged home with continuation therapy of Bactrim DS and outpatient follow-up instructions. However, she was re-admitted to the hospital within a week of discharge with worsening dyspnea and cough with expectorations. Vitals showed sinus tachycardia with heart rate 110/min. Other vitals like BP, temperature, respiratory rate were normal. Chest X-ray on admission showed perihilar opacities unchanged from previous admission (Figure ). Physical examination revealed rales bilaterally. The rest of examinations, including gastrointestinal, neurological, cardiovascular system, were normal. Treatment was initiated with broad spectrum antibiotics Vancomycin and Meropenem intravenous (IV) in view of possible superadded bacterial infection. On day 2 of admission, she complained of severe epigastric pain radiating to back and also was noted to have pruritic macular rashes over face and neck. As initial suspicion was Varicella Zoster (VZ) infection vs. drug-induced rash, Bactrim was stopped, and she was started on Valacyclovir orally. Serum lipase and amylase were elevated at 160 IU/dl (reference range less than 50 IU/dl) and 133 IU/dl (reference range less than 110 IU/dl) respectively. The rest of the labs, including blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, were normal. She was also started on IV hydration with isotonic normal saline and pain management with opioids for pancreatitis. Her clinical condition continued to worsen gradually, and the rash became more generalized with pruritic vesicular-papular eruptions. She developed a low-grade fever and became hypotension - BP 70/40 (she required inotropic support with norepinephrine for three days). Other systemic organs were also involved, as evident by laboratory abnormalities. Over the course of hospital stay, her labs got worsened significantly - platelet counts dropped remarkably (125-66-30---26---24); Lipase/amylase continued to increase (160/133-379/663---254/491); liver functions worsened with aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) gradually increased (180/128---389/227---837/501) (reference range < 40 for both); LDH was high (2438---2565-1308); lactic acid increased (3.7-2.4) [reference range < 2 mmol/L]. Given the worsening clinical status, she was switched to Acyclovir 500 mg IV. Her blood culture and urine culture sent on admission day returned negative for any bacterial infection; four days later, her VZ virus DNA PCR from skin blister and serum both reported positive confirming active VZV infection.\n",
      "Ultrasound abdomen did not reveal any gallstones. Echocardiogram did not suggest any source of septic emboli.\n",
      "Her clinical condition improved gradually with near normalization of labs. She completed 14 days course of antimicrobials for disseminated varicella. Eventually, she was started on an anti-retroviral drug Stribild (Dolutegravir/Lamivudine) daily along with a prophylactic dose of Dapsone (for PCP). Post treatment completion, oral Valacyclovir was initiated for viral suppression. After the acute stay in hospital for three weeks, she recovered well and was followed up regularly in the clinic with no further recurrence in six months of follow-up.\n",

      "A 38-year-old G2P2 African American woman presented with 3-hour duration of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Her pain was acute in onset and constant in nature, radiated to both groins, and was progressively worsening. She denied any musculoskeletal pain. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension, fibroid uterus, and a cholecystectomy. She had worsening menorrhagia over the past two months. Her last gynecologic evaluation was three years prior to presentation. She reported tobacco use and denied alcohol or drug consumption. Physical examination revealed diffuse rebound tenderness and a palpable abdominal mass. Initial vital signs were as follows: temperature of 38.6°C, heart rate of 122 beats per minute, blood pressure of 48/37, and respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 88% and increased to 94% on 2 liters of nasal oxygen.\n",
      "Biochemical testing showed an elevated white blood cell count (13.5 K/μL), significant neutrophilia (94.8%), an elevatedcreatinine (3.8 mg/dL), low hemoglobin (8.9 g/dL), low potassium (3.2 mEq/L), and an elevated myoglobin (2140 ng/mL, normal range: 0–101 ng/mL). A cardiac and skeletal muscle enzyme panel was normal. Baseline creatinine from a prior admission was normal (0.6 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed trace blood and amorphous sediment. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed a 24 cm × 13 cm × 13 cm complex mass occupying the pelvis and extending to the upper abdomen (). Both kidneys appeared normal in size without perinephric inflammation, hydronephrosis, or hydroureter. Renal sonography revealed normal echotexture and ureteral caliber.\n",
      "The working diagnosis was acute septic shock with associated acute renal failure. The patient had nonanion gap metabolic acidosis with a lactic acid level of 4.5 mmol/L (normal 0.4–2 mmol/L) and a pH of 7.40 with a compensatory decrease in PCO secondary to hyperventilation. Blood and urine cultures were obtained and the patient was started on intravenous fluid resuscitation, a bicarbonate drip, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. A norepinephrine infusion was used to maintain a normotensive state. The pelvic mass was thought to be the source of the patient's abdominal pain and represented a degenerating fibroid that was contributing to her critical presentation with worsening inflammation and myoglobinemia. Relevant tumor markers including CEA, AFP, CA-125, and inhibins A and B were normal.\n",
      "The patient's overall status continued to worsen the following day. She became obtunded with loss of consciousness, in sinus tachycardia, and hypotensive despite all aforementioned measures. Endotracheal intubation then followed. Furthermore, her renal function continued to deteriorate (creatinine of 7 mg/dL). Urine and blood cultures had still not yielded any bacterial growth. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated and the decision to perform an exploratory laparotomy and remove the pelvic mass followed, as it was attributed to the patient's worsening critical state.\n",
      "A large solitary fibroid was found within the left broad ligament that was densely adherent and contiguous with the uterus. The uterus and adnexal structures appeared significantly devitalized and edematous and were displacing the ureters without evidence of hydroureter. The bowels appeared normal. A total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed with an estimated blood loss of 150 mL. The patient remained intubated and returned to the surgical intensive care unit. The postoperative period was complicated by atrial fibrillation that responded to intravenous amiodarone in addition to anemia (Hg 6.7 g/dL) requiring blood transfusion.\n",
      "Dramatic biochemical improvement occurred over the next 48 hours with CRRT following surgery. Final blood and urine cultures were negative at 48 hours. Serum creatinine decreased to 1.4 mg/dL but however rebounded slowly over the following three days and peaked at 3.1 mg/dL. Serum myoglobin reached a nadir of 380.4 ng/mL by the fourth postoperative day (POD) and steadily increased and reached a plateau of 1074 ng/mL by POD-8 (). Clinical improvement followed with defervescence and normalization of vital signs by POD-3 and POD-5, respectively. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were discontinued at this time. The patient had normal sinus rhythm, was normotensive without any vasopressors, and was extubated uneventfully. The pathology reported a 29.4 × 20.8 × 19.7 cm large solitary leiomyoma weighing 3028 grams and showing extensive loss of nuclei from cells, stromal hyalinization, polymorphonuclear white blood cell infiltrate, and foci of calcifications reflecting various stages of early and late fibroid degenerative changes (). Both adnexal structures showed an extensive infiltrate of polymorphonuclear cells suggestive of severe and acute inflammation.\n",
      "The patient was discharged on POD-8 in a stable condition. Serum creatinine remained stable at 2.9 mg/dL, and myoglobin was 1074 ng/mL. She showed complete biochemical and clinical remission by her 4-week follow-up with a return to baseline serum creatinine (0.6 mg/dL) and a normal serum myoglobin of 25 ng/mL ().

He had elevated cardiac markers (troponin I of 0.1 ng/mL) with electrocardiogram showing Q waves in leads II, III avf showing evolved inferior wall (IW) and right ventricle (RV) MI. A two-dimensional echocardiography showed hypokinetic basal septum and a huge VSR [] of 18 × 20 mm in size shunting left to right [] with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (RV systolic pressure of 75 mmHg) and biventricular dysfunction and mild mitral regurgitation (MR) with an RV wall motion index (WMI) of 0.8. An elective coronary angiogram showed proximal tight occlusions of both the right coronary artery (RCA) and the obtuse marginal (OM) branch of the left circumflex. The left anterior descending artery was normal. He was planned for surgical closure of the VSR with grafts to OM and RCA territories after a week's time.\n",
      "A Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted after induction showing a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 24 mmHg, a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and diastolic pressure (DP) of 60 and 33 mmHg, respectively, and a diastolic pulmonary gradient of 9 mmHg. The central venous pressure (CVP) was 15 mmHg. Simultaneous right atrial and pulmonary artery saturations showed a step up of 30%. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was instituted with aorto bicaval cannulation and the heart was arrested by Del Nido cardioplegia (aortic root). After adequate retraction, a vertical left ventriculotomy was done parallel to the posterior descending artery (PDA) in the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. The VSR was visualized with difficulty by retracting the papillary muscle [] and its chordae tendinae. It was closed with bovine pericardium with interrupted 2-0 polypropylene sutures using David technique. The left ventriculotomy was closed [] followed by OM and PDA grafting as planned. After adequate period of CPB support with an aortic cross clamp time of 88 min and CPB time of 145 min, the patient was weaned off CPB. Transesophageal echo showed intact VSR patch with biventricular dysfunction. During closure, arterial pressures were 100/60 mmHg with a PASP of 45 and DP of 23 mmHg. The patient was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with supports of inj. dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min, inj. adrenaline 0.08 μg/kg/min, and inj. vasopressin 2 IU/h. As the cardiac contractility was reasonably alright, IABP was not inserted in the operation theater with a low threshold of insertion in case of eventuality.\n",
      "The patient was shifted to the ICU with continuous monitoring with cardiac output (CO) of 3.5 L/min and cardiac index (CI) of 1.9 L/min/m2 and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) of 1900 dynes-s/cm5. After 6 h, there was a drop in CO and SVR elevation, and hence a 40-cc IABP was inserted percutaneously through the right common femoral artery (CFA). The patient's hemodynamics improved and he was extubated on the second postoperative day (POD). As he was hemodynamically stable, on the fourth POD, IABP was removed with inj. dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min and inj. adrenaline 0.05 μg/kg/min. Six hours later, there was once again a drop in the CI and CO and echo showed severe RV dysfunction with a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) value of 8 mm. Inotropes were hiked with no further improvement. Twelve hours later, the patient became dyspneic, tachypneic with a mixed venous oxygen saturation (MVO2) of 35%, and a pulmonary vascular resistance of 250 dynes-s/cm5 and was electively re-intubated in view of hypoxia due to low cardiac output. A sheathless 34-cc IABP was re-inserted percutaneously through the left CFA. The hemodynamics improved and MVO2 improved to 70%. He was extubated the next day and a decision was made to retain the IABP. The IABP was removed after 10 days (1:1 augmentation for 8 days and 1:2 for the next 48 h and 1:3 for the next 24 h) and inotropes were reduced. Repeat echo showed improvement in the RV function with a TAPSE improving to 12 mm. He was discharged in a stable condition on 18th POD. Discharge echo revealed intact VSR patch [] with moderate biventricular dysfunctionand TAPSE value of 12 mm and moderate MR [].

      "History\n",
      "A 52-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department complaining of pleuritic, sharp pain in his right chest wall that had begun three days prior to arrival. The pain had since worsened in intensity, and did not radiate. He had taken acetaminophen without relief of his symptoms. The patient denied any fever, cough, shortness of breath, headache, or rash. His review of symptoms was otherwise negative. The patient had no significant past medical history and was taking no medications. He denied any recent history of surgery or trauma, but did note weight lifting two days prior to the onset of symptoms. Family history was negative for coagulopathies and autoimmune conditions.\n",
      "Exam findings\n",
      "Vital signs on arrival were blood pressure 146/97, heart rate 97, temperature 36.2°C, respiratory rate 20, and SpO2 99% on room air. He was alert and oriented, and in no acute distress. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally and heart sounds were normal. A raised cord was visible crossing from the epigastrium across the right breast toward the axilla, that was tender to palpation and mobile. There was no warmth, erythema, or rash overlying the cord. Head/eyes/ears/nose/throat, abdominal, and neurological examinations were unremarkable.\n",
      "Diagnostic evaluation\n",
      "Basic metabolic panel and troponin levels were normal, and a complete blood count and differential was unremarkable with platelets of 212 bil/L. Chest radiograph showed clear lung fields but did reveal remote right-sided posterior fractures of ribs five through eight. Given the pleuritic nature of the pain, a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram was ordered to rule out pulmonary embolism. As shown in Figure , it revealed a subtle density in the right chest wall over the area of the palpable cord, with no evidence of a pulmonary embolism. The diagnosis of superficial chest wall thrombophlebitis, or Mondor’s disease, was made.\n",

      "History\n",
      "A 52-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department complaining of pleuritic, sharp pain in his right chest wall that had begun three days prior to arrival. The pain had since worsened in intensity, and did not radiate. He had taken acetaminophen without relief of his symptoms. The patient denied any fever, cough, shortness of breath, headache, or rash. His review of symptoms was otherwise negative. The patient had no significant past medical history and was taking no medications. He denied any recent history of surgery or trauma, but did note weight lifting two days prior to the onset of symptoms. Family history was negative for coagulopathies and autoimmune conditions.\n",
      "Exam findings\n",
      "Vital signs on arrival were blood pressure 146/97, heart rate 97, temperature 36.2°C, respiratory rate 20, and SpO2 99% on room air. He was alert and oriented, and in no acute distress. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally and heart sounds were normal. A raised cord was visible crossing from the epigastrium across the right breast toward the axilla, that was tender to palpation and mobile. There was no warmth, erythema, or rash overlying the cord. Head/eyes/ears/nose/throat, abdominal, and neurological examinations were unremarkable.\n",
      "Diagnostic evaluation\n",
      "Basic metabolic panel and troponin levels were normal, and a complete blood count and differential was unremarkable with platelets of 212 bil/L. Chest radiograph showed clear lung fields but did reveal remote right-sided posterior fractures of ribs five through eight. Given the pleuritic nature of the pain, a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram was ordered to rule out pulmonary embolism. As shown in Figure , it revealed a subtle density in the right chest wall over the area of the palpable cord, with no evidence of a pulmonary embolism. The diagnosis of superficial chest wall thrombophlebitis, or Mondor’s disease, was made.\n",

      "The patient was treated with ibuprofen in the emergency department and discharged with a naproxen prescription. He was referred to his primary care physician for further work-up.

      "Patient Note:\n",
      "A 57-year-old white man presented with a 3-month history of new-onset, severe, bi-frontal headaches and a 13.6 kg (30-lb) weight loss. Local emergency room evaluation revealed a negative computed tomography (CT) scan of his head. Laboratory findings included an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 80 mm/hour and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 55.3 mg/L. He was discharged with pain control.\n",
      "During follow-up with his local primary provider, his headache persisted and bilateral jaw pain and left facial numbness had developed. He was started on prednisone 60 mg/day for presumed GCA with partial improvement in his headache. Bilateral temporal artery biopsies were performed 3 days later and were negative. Prednisone was subsequently discontinued. Two weeks later his headache progressed and right eye horizontal diplopia and perioral numbness developed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain was performed and interpreted as normal. He was admitted for pulse-dose steroids (1000 mg daily for 3 days) which led to resolution of visual symptoms and was discharged on prednisone 60 mg/day. Tapering below 50 mg/day was unsuccessful due to rising inflammatory markers, symptom progression, and return of diplopia. Severe left hip pain developed for which plain radiographs were obtained but negative for fracture or avascular necrosis.\n",
      "On referral to our institution he continued to have ongoing headache and left jaw numbness despite 6 weeks of high-dose glucocorticoids (80 mg/day). Left hip pain had worsened to the point of wheelchair dependency. His past medical history was remarkable for atrial fibrillation for which he was receiving warfarin 2 mg/day and diltiazem 240 mg/day. Social history was notable for lack of tobacco or alcohol use and absence of known environmental exposures during his employment as an office manager. Aside from prostate cancer in his father, our patient’s family history was negative for other pertinent diagnoses of additional malignancies or autoimmune conditions. Laboratory evaluation noted an ESR 72 mm/hour, CRP 53 mg/L, hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL, leukocytes 5.2 × 109/L and platelets 110 × 109/L, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.3, creatinine 1.04 mg/dL, calcium 11.6 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase 106 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 64 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 360 U/L, total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL, total protein 5.1 g/dL, and albumin 3.4 g/dL. Previously obtained autoimmune serologies were negative for antinuclear and extractable nuclear antigens as well as rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, myeloperoxidase, and proteinase-3 antibodies.\n",
      "His vital signs demonstrated a heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 94/44 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 12 per minute, oxygenation saturation of 96%, and weight of 144 kg with body mass index (BMI) of 48.6 kg/m2. An examination was notable for a Cushingoid appearance and morbid obesity. Evaluation of adenopathy and splenomegaly was limited due to body habitus. Pertinent cardiovascular findings included irregularly irregular pulse without murmurs. Upper and lower arterial pulses were normal and symmetric. Common superficial temporal artery palpation was without tenderness or nodularity. Trace pitting edema was noted to the ankle bilaterally. Breath sounds were equal and symmetric without wheezing or rhonchi. Aside from scattered bruising at site of venipuncture, no cutaneous abnormalities were noted. A neurologic examination showed normal speech without language deficits. Visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally. Cranial nerves 2–12 were assessed and normal except for mild esotropia of his right eye and hypoesthesia to light touch and pinprick over the left mandibular region of the left trigeminal nerve. The remaining dermatomes evaluated showed normal sensation. Reflexes were normal and symmetric throughout and toes were down-going bilaterally. No ataxia was observed. A musculoskeletal examination demonstrated normal range of motion of upper extremities without deficit. Marked pain was noted on passive and active range of motion of his left hip.\n",
      "Given the persistent headache despite high-dose glucocorticoids and atypical features, alternative etiologies were suspected. The local MRI of his brain was reviewed and evidence of abnormal enhancing soft tissue involving Meckel’s cave bilaterally with extension through the foramen ovale was noted (Fig. a). The differential diagnosis for infiltrative process in Meckel’s cave included sarcoidosis as well as primary or secondary neoplastic lesions such as meningioma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, schwannoma, neurofibroma, and lymphoma [, ]. The presence of constitutional symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers suggested a secondary process with associated intracranial involvement. As such, positron emission tomography (PET)-CT was obtained. This demonstrated extensive hypermetabolic lesions throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton, including the skull base, as well as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm (Fig. c). MRI of his left hip revealed diffusely abnormal marrow signal suggestive of infiltrative disease. A cervical lymph node biopsy demonstrated evidence of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and staging bone marrow biopsy revealed a hypercellular marrow (90%) with diffuse large B cell lymphoma involving 70% of the total cellularity (Fig. ). Initiation of high-dose methotrexate (3.5 g/m2), rituximab (375 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m2), hydroxydaunorubicin (50 mg/m2), Oncovin (vincristine; 2 mg), and prednisone (255 mg) (MR-CHOP; 21-day cycle) resulted in interval improvement in his headache and visual symptoms (Fig. b, d).\n",
      "Ten months after initial diagnosis and 4 months after completion of his sixth cycle of MR-CHOP, our patient re-presented with bilateral lower extremity weakness and PET-CT showed recurrence of disease with evidence of neurolymphomatosis of multiple cervical, thoracic, and sacral nerve roots. Intrathecal cytarabine (50 mg) was given and ibrutinib (140 mg/day) was initiated, resulting in initial findings of improved strength and subsequent decreased nerve root FDG-avidity.\n",

      "A 63-year-old Caucasian male with a history only significant for daily marijuana use received the J&J COVID-19 vaccine on May 7, 2021. One day later, he developed intractable nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, watery diarrhea, chills, sweats, and heavy chest pain. In the emergency department (ED), the patient was tachycardic at 120 beats per minute, hypoxic with oxygen 88% on room air, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) 3421 pg/ml, elevated troponins at 1.29 ng/ml, procalcitonin 25 ng/ml, lactic acid 5.0 mmol/L, white blood cells 19 K/UL, thrombocytopenia at 101 K/UL, and creatinine 1.91 mg/dL. Initial chest X-ray showed bilateral airspace opacities consistent with atypical pneumonia. The patient was intubated because he was in severe respiratory distress with use of accessory muscles and decreased oxygen saturation. Ventilator settings are presented in Table .\n",
      "Echo showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 25% with global hypokinesis and grade 3 diastolic dysfunction. A right heart catheterization was performed, showing severe pulmonary hypertension. An intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted, but his condition continued to decline, so a left-sided Impella device (Impella Cardiosystems AG, Aachen, Germany) was placed and milrinone and norepinephrine were started.\n",
      "The patient was worked up for infectious causes and all were negative including two negative COVID-19 results, viral panel, blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum cultures, and urine legionella. A chest X-ray five days after presenting to the ED is shown below (Figure ).\n",
      "Throughout his nine-day hospital stay, he continued to have rapid cyclical fluctuations of hypertension (260s/130s) and hypotension (40s/20s), persistent fevers up to 40.2 °C, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like picture. His other problems included acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from an acute kidney injury (AKI), hypernatremia, arterial catheter-associated thrombosis in mid left radial artery leading to gangrene of left 1st and 2nd digits, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with cardiogenic shock (on May 10, 2021, EF was 55% with no diastolic dysfunction), subclinical hyperthyroidism, and electroencephalogram (EEG) showed diffuse slowing, with no epileptiform activity. Echo on May 15, 2021 showed EF of 43% with mild global hypokinesis.\n",
      "Neuroendocrine crisis was suspected, and the patient was worked up for pheochromocytoma and carcinoid syndrome (Table ).\n",
      "The results of retroperitoneal ultrasound are shown below (Figures -).\n",
      "The first step in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is to discontinue medications that may interfere with metanephrine levels such as norepinephrine. Due to our patient's labile blood pressure measurements, he was on and off of vasopressors (such as norepinephrine) and anti-hypertensive medications (nitroglycerin). The results of significantly elevated 24-hour urine fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines or elevated fractionated plasma metanephrines confirms the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Imaging with CT or MRI is done to localize the tumor. Our patient was not stable enough for these imaging tests and thus we had to do an ultrasound. There were no previous imaging studies on record for this patient or a family history that could explain the etiology of his tumor.\n",
      "The patient was transferred to the University of Michigan (U of M) hospital for mass resection on May 21, 2021. A CT was performed that day to confirm the ultrasound finding of a 7 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass. The patient continued to suffer from acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and a tracheostomy was performed on June 07, 2021 due to prolonged intubation. His stay at U of M hospital was also complicated by episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) that responded well to synchronized cardioversion. He was also placed on amiodarone. On June 18, 2021, an open right adrenalectomy was performed and on June 22, 2021, repeat plasma metanephrine was <0.2 nmol/L, and normetanephrine was 0.9 nmol/L. An echo performed on June 22, 2021 revealed a left ventricular EF of 63%, normal overall left ventricular systolic function, normal overall right ventricular systolic function, and no significant valvular dysfunction. Multiple upper and lower extremity deep vein thromboses (DVTs) were found on June 24, 2021. The patient was treated with blood thinners and stabilized for transfer to inpatient rehabilitation on July 02, 2021. The patient was then discharged on July 12, 2021 to stay with his sister. He has continued outpatient therapy and is now able to walk on his own and perform all of his activities of daily living independently. He will follow up with endocrine genetics for the etiology of his pheochromocytoma, cardiology, and physical medicine and rehabilitation. He will continue amiodarone for NSVT and rivaroxaban for the DVTs until the end of September 2021. The patient is doing very well overall.\n",

      "The subject of this report is a 29 year old male, US citizen of Palestinian descent, who works full-time as a biomedical research technician. His health history is unremarkable, except for the fact that at age 16 he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Since then, he has been treated successfully with mesalamine (1.2 g, 2 times per day), azathioprine (50 mg, 3 times per day), and ursidiol (300 mg, 2 times per day). The subject has been able to live an active lifestyle and participate in a variety of sports including running, weightlifting, basketball, and baseball. The subject denies any history of smoking or use of alcohol, opioids, or illicit drugs. On April 22, 2020, the subject's father, who lives in the same house as the subject, and works for a major shipping company, was diagnosed with COVID-19. This was about 2 months after the first case of COVID had been confirmed in his state of residence, which was one of the early active zones of COVID-19 transmission in the US. On April 25, the patient began to experience general malaise and fatigue. Over the next 24 h, the symptoms worsened to include severe fatigue and weakness, loss of appetite, tiredness, slight dry cough, body aches, muscle pain, loss of taste and smell, sore throat and fever. The patient was then seen by his general practice physician. Vital signs at the time of examination were BP 110/72, pulse 97 BPM, respiration 14 per minute, oxygen saturation 98%, and body temperature 101.7°F. The patient was given a naso-pharyngeal swab, real-time RT-PCR test [COBAS (R) SARS-COV-@ test, Labcorp Laboratories, South Bend, IN] that confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19. In compliance with standard medical practice standards, the patient was ordered to self-isolate and to start a 5-day course of azithromycin (250 mg, daily), and to also take 1 g of paracetamol (acetaminophen) every 6 h for treatment of pain and fever. Despite good adherence to the recommended treatment, the symptoms other than fever, did not improve, and he also started to feel depressed, demotivated, and spend long periods in bed. During this period, the patient experienced ongoing generalized myalgia and musculoskeletal pain. He described the pain as persistent and relatively severe (rated 7 on a scale of 1–10). Because of this discomfort, after 4 days the patient decided to consume kratom to relieve his symptoms. According to the patient, he had first used kratom 14 months earlier before his COVID-19 infection. He used kratom sporadically (no more than 4–5 times in total) as a cognitive enhancer and not to self-treat pain.\n",
      "The patient decided to take 2.5 gms (or grams) of green kratom (as ground leaf powder suspended in water). The product was purchased at a local shop in April 2020 sold under the name “Green Bali.” After 30 min, he noticed a significant improvement in the intensity of the physical symptoms (mainly pain and fatigue), and within 60 min he felt a sensation of mild euphoria and well-being that lasted for about 5 h. After 6 h following consumption the effects of kratom wore off, and the patient administered another dose. He used kratom three times a day continuously for 3 days (for a total of 9 doses of 2.75 g each) with significant benefit.\n",
      "When asked to score from 0 to 100% the improvement that kratom had on COVID-19 symptoms: fatigue and weakness (80% improvement), tiredness (70% improvement), body aches (80% improvement), muscle pain (90% improvement, “much better than paracetamol/acetaminophen”). The kratom did not seem to have an impact on: fever, cough, or sore throat. The patient also stated: “I didn't have anxiety or any psychological symptoms. For me, kratom mainly gave improvement in physical reaction.” “It also elevated my mood and made me feel less miserable, to the point where I was able to get out of bed, shower, look at work emails without feeling completely exhausted and drained”; “Kratom helped me more than antibiotic”; “I slept better, I essentially fell asleep immediately. Without kratom, sleep was not nice, with kratom less wake ups, about 6 h.” Over the next 2 weeks the patient's symptoms gradually subsided and on May 13 he had a televisit with his physician and a follow-up swab test that was negative for COVID-19. The subject was able to end his quarantine and return to work in early June. In a follow-up interview with us, the patient reported that he did not experience any side effects from using kratom, except for a very bad taste when swallowing it. The patient was also able to discontinue kratom use immediately without any evidence of physical or psychological withdrawal symptoms. The patient also informed us that he still had some of the kratom product that he had taken and he agreed to provide us with a sample for chemical analysis.\n",
      "An established quantitative liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method was conducted () and found that the sample obtained from the patient is kratom due to the presence of mitragynine (102 mg/g kratom powder) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (0.8 mg/g kratom powder). The extracted kratom sample was analyzed for the presence of 13 opioids and 8 benzodiazepines by comparing the chromatograms to those of the reference mixtures Pain Management Multi-component Opiate Mixture-13 solution and Benzodiazepine Multi-component Mixture-8 solution. These data suggest the sample was not fortified with 7-hydroxymitragynine and there was also no evidence of adulteration with opioids or common benzodiazepines in the sample.\n",

His headache started two weeks prior, and he noted temperatures up to 40 degrees Celsius in the preceding five days. He denied neck pain, visual complaints, respiratory symptoms, or arthralgias. He denied recent travel, eating unpasteurized milk products, and sexual activity for the last several years. Two days prior to presentation, he was evaluated by the Emergency Department and was discharged with a presumed viral illness. Because of persistent fever and headache, he returned to the Emergency Department where he was admitted for further evaluation.\n",
      "His medical history was significant for open-angle glaucoma and seasonal allergies. Outpatient medications included travoprost and dorzolamide ophthalmic drops. Multiple family members had diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and his father had a diagnosis of leukemia. He denied use of tobacco or illicit drugs. He drank alcohol rarely.\n",

      "A 69-year-old Caucasian woman presented to outside hospital with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. Chest pain started approximately a week ago and lasted for about 5 days but then subsided for a day. Next day, the patient was experiencing continuous chest tightness both on right and left side. She was also having dyspnea on exertion. The patient had a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and severe degenerative joint disease. Past surgical history was significant for hysterectomy. She denied any history of smoking cigarettes or using illicit drugs. The patient had a history of occasional alcohol intake. Medications at home included amlodipine/benazepril 10/20 mg daily, raloxifene 60 mg daily, celecoxib 200 mg BID, clonazepam 1 mg daily, fenofibrate 145 mg daily, a multivitamin tablet daily, a calcium tablet 600 mg daily, glucosamine 1500 mg daily, tramadol/acetaminophen 37.5/325 mg BID, and hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10/300 mg as needed for pain.\n",
      "On arrival to the emergency department, the patient was tachycardic with a heart rate of 114/min, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24/min. She was normotensive at that time. Within the next few minutes, the patient became significantly hypotensive. Vitals at that time were blood pressure 78/52, heart rate 109/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and saturation of 96% on 3 L of oxygen via nasal cannula. On physical examination, the patient appeared to be in acute distress. On cardiovascular assessment, S1 and S2 were audible with no added murmur or gallop. She had bilateral pitting lower extremity edema. On lung examination, the patient had bilateral rhonchi and increased respiratory effort.\n",
      "EKG showed sinus tachycardia with q waves and ST segment elevations of almost 2 mm in leads III and aVF. There was also left atrial enlargement (). Radiograph of chest showed interstitial edema. Laboratory results from admission included a basal metabolic panel that showed blood urea nitrogen of 40 mg/dL (6–20 mg/dL), creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL (0.7–1.2 mg/dL), and potassium of 4.2 mEq/L (3.5–5.0 mEq/L). First set of troponin levels were found to be 1.60 ng/mL (0.0–0.3 ng/mL) and first set of CK was 118 U/L (29–200 U/L). A Doppler echocardiogram was done in the emergency room, which showed normal ejection fraction of 60–65% with RV hypokinesis, which was consistent with RVI.\n",
      "The patient was started on vasopressors and emergently transferred to our facility to undergo cardiac catheterization. Left heart catheterization revealed 99% stenosis to mid-right coronary artery and subsequently the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the right coronary artery. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed during cardiac catheterization as the patient was in cardiogenic shock. After successful PCI, the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed as her vitals seemed to have stabilized. Two days later, again the patient developed hypotension and worsening shortness of breath. Urgent bedside Doppler echocardiogram showed a new left-to-right shunt in the ventricle, which was noted to be a muscular VSD. The patient was transferred to a tertiary care medical center for surgical repair. At the tertiary care hospital, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was done, which revealed large VSD with a dimension of 1.38×0.9 cm2 and an area of 0.9 cm2 located in the posterior wall of ventricle (). TEE also showed mildly reduced RV systolic function and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation ( and ).\n",
      "The patient subsequently developed S. aureus bacteremia and Clostridium difficile colitis, which were successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics. She underwent cardiothoracic surgery for possible surgical versus percutaneous repair of the VSD. Based on the location of the VSD, the patient was considered to be an excellent candidate for percutaneous repair with amplatzer postinfarct VSD occluder device. After placement of the amplatzer VSD device, significant reduction in left-to-right shunt was noted on TEE. Also, hemodynamically the patient improved and her hypotension resolved, so the intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued. Eventually, the patient developed sepsis secondary to C. difficile colitis, which resulted in development of disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemodynamic collapse, and death.\n",

Vitals at that time were blood pressure 78/52, heart rate 109/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and saturation of 96% on 3 L of oxygen via nasal cannula. On physical examination, the patient appeared to be in acute distress. On cardiovascular assessment, S1 and S2 were audible with no added murmur or gallop. She had bilateral pitting lower extremity edema. On lung examination, the patient had bilateral rhonchi and increased respiratory effort.\n",
      "EKG showed sinus tachycardia with q waves and ST segment elevations of almost 2 mm in leads III and aVF. There was also left atrial enlargement (). Radiograph of chest showed interstitial edema. Laboratory results from admission included a basal metabolic panel that showed blood urea nitrogen of 40 mg/dL (6–20 mg/dL), creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL (0.7–1.2 mg/dL), and potassium of 4.2 mEq/L (3.5–5.0 mEq/L). First set of troponin levels were found to be 1.60 ng/mL (0.0–0.3 ng/mL) and first set of CK was 118 U/L (29–200 U/L). A Doppler echocardiogram was done in the emergency room, which showed normal ejection fraction of 60–65% with RV hypokinesis, which was consistent with RVI.\n",
      "The patient was started on vasopressors and emergently transferred to our facility to undergo cardiac catheterization. Left heart catheterization revealed 99% stenosis to mid-right coronary artery and subsequently the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the right coronary artery. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed during cardiac catheterization as the patient was in cardiogenic shock. After successful PCI, the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed as her vitals seemed to have stabilized. Two days later, again the patient developed hypotension and worsening shortness of breath. Urgent bedside Doppler echocardiogram showed a new left-to-right shunt in the ventricle, which was noted to be a muscular VSD. The patient was transferred to a tertiary care medical center for surgical repair. At the tertiary care hospital, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was done, which revealed large VSD with a dimension of 1.38×0.9 cm2 and an area of 0.9 cm2 located in the posterior wall of ventricle (). TEE also showed mildly reduced RV systolic function and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation ( and ).\n",
      "The patient subsequently developed S. aureus bacteremia and Clostridium difficile colitis, which were successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics. She underwent cardiothoracic surgery for possible surgical versus percutaneous repair of the VSD. Based on the location of the VSD, the patient was considered to be an excellent candidate for percutaneous repair with amplatzer postinfarct VSD occluder device. After placement of the amplatzer VSD device, significant reduction in left-to-right shunt was noted on TEE. Also, hemodynamically the patient improved and her hypotension resolved, so the intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued. Eventually, the patient developed sepsis secondary to C. difficile colitis, which resulted in development of disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemodynamic collapse, and death.\n",

      "A 27-year-old African American female patient with a history of stage IV endometriosis presented to the emergency department with exertional dyspnea of three-month duration. She also had an unintentional weight loss of approximately 25 pounds. The patient also endorsed night sweats, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and orthopnea, but she denied chest pain or lower extremity swelling. Of notice, the patient had an endometrial cyst removal performed five years ago and an endometriosis-related paracentesis performed three years ago. The last follow-up with obstetrics/gynecology was 13 months ago.\n",
      "On presentation, the patient had a blood pressure of 120/78 mmHg, a temperature of 36.6°C, a heart rate range of 75-90 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Chest auscultation revealed absent breath sounds on the right side of the chest.\n",
      "Laboratory studies were significant for a hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dl (12-16 g/dl). Other complete blood count parameters and electrolytes were within normal limits. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed complete opacification of the right chest with a left tracheal deviation (Figure ). Computed tomography of pulmonary arteries (CT-PA) was negative for pulmonary emboli, but it showed a massive right pleural effusion with complete atelectasis of the right lung in addition to a left-sided cardiomediastinal shift (Figure ). Thoracocentesis with the removal of 2 to 3 l of serosanguinous fluid was performed, fluids turned to be exudative with few glandular and endometrial cells on cytohistological examination. Because the patient’s condition was not improving, a chest tube was placed. Continuous chest tube drainage with serosanguinous fluid was noted for eight days. Because the patient’s condition did not significantly improve, a right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), a right diaphragm and pleural biopsy, and pleurodesis were performed, which revealed dense fibroconnective tissue with prominent chronic inflammation, including lymphoid aggregates and focal mesothelial hyperplasia (Figure ). No malignancy was reported in the histopathologic examination.\n",
      "Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis in addition to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was done; these investigations showed endometrioma of about 7.2 × 7.1 × 4.2 cm in the mid-upper pelvis with a moderate amount of hemorrhagic fluid in the pelvis and bilateral paracolic gutters (Figure ), and the latter finding was similar to a prior finding on a CT scan of the abdomen that was done three years ago. Because these fluids did not cause any symptoms to the patient, the obstetrics/gynecology team’s decision was not to drain, believing that the endometriosis treatment itself should improve this condition.\n",
      "Transvaginal ultrasonography and complete pelvic duplex ultrasonography of the lower abdomen showed a large septate cystic lesion in the left adnexa, which has been present for three years. The lesion was consistent with endometrioma (Figure ). The patient was discharged on Leuprolide Depot 11.25 mg injections every three months and norethindrone hormonal therapy of 5 mg tablets daily to prevent menopausal symptoms, with a close outpatient follow-up.\n",
