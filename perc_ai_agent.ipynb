However, the patient's negative BAL stains and cultures, as well as the negative serum and BAL galactomannan and serum cryptococcal antigen, make a bacterial or fungal pneumonia less likely. The patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are consistent with a drug-induced pneumonitis, which is a known complication of certain medications, including dapsone. To calculate the PERC score, we will use the following criteria: age > 50 years, oxygen saturation < 95% on room air, heart rate > 100 bpm, systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure < 60 mmHg, respiratory rate > 24 breaths per minute, altered mental state, pulse oximetry < 95% on room air, and temperature < 36°C or > 38°C. Based on the patient's vital signs and physical examination, the following criteria are met: age > 50 years (score 1), oxygen saturation < 95% on room air (score 1), and respiratory rate > 24 breaths per minute (score 1). The patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature are within normal limits, and there is no evidence of altered mental state or pulse oximetry < 95% on room air.
