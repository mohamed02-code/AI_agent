      "To calculate the PERC (Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria) score, we need to assess the patient's risk factors for pulmonary embolism (PE) based on the provided clinical information. The PERC score is used to determine the likelihood of PE in patients with a low pretest probability. The criteria include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Age < 50 years\n",
      "2. Pulse < 100 beats per minute\n",
      "3. SaO2 > 94% on room air\n",
      "4. No unilateral leg swelling\n",
      "5. No hemoptysis\n",
      "6. No recent trauma or surgery\n",
      "7. No history of DVT or PE\n",
      "8. No exogenous estrogen use\n",
      "\n",
      "For each criterion that is met, 1 point is assigned. If all 8 criteria are met, the patient has a PERC score of 8, indicating a very low risk of PE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided patient note:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Age: The patient is 73 years old, so she does not meet the first criterion (Age < 50 years).\n",
      "- Pulse: Her heart rate is 92 beats per minute, which meets the second criterion (Pulse < 100 beats per minute).\n",
      "- SaO2: Her oxygen saturation is 98% on room air, which meets the third criterion (SaO2 > 94% on room air).\n",
      "- Unilateral leg swelling: There is no mention of unilateral leg swelling, so this criterion is met.\n",
      "- Hemoptysis: There is no mention of hemoptysis, so this criterion is met.\n",
      "- Recent trauma or surgery: The patient was involved in a motor vehicle collision, which could be considered recent trauma, so this criterion is not met.\n",
      "- History of DVT or PE: There is no mention of a history of DVT or PE, so this criterion is met.\n",
      "- Exogenous estrogen use: There is no mention of exogenous estrogen use, and given her history of breast cancer treated with tamoxifen and letrozole, it's unlikely she is on exogenous estrogen, so this criterion is met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these points, the patient meets 7 out of the 8 criteria. However, the PERC rule is typically applied as an all-or-none rule to rule out PE in low-risk patients. Since the patient does not meet all the criteria due to her age and recent trauma, the PERC score does not directly apply to rule out PE without further testing in this clinical context.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, to follow the instruction for calculating and presenting a score based on the criteria provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient would score 6 out of 8 based on the criteria directly mentioned and applicable:\n",
      "- Age: 0\n",
      "- Pulse: 1\n",
      "- SaO2: 1\n",
      "- No unilateral leg swelling: 1\n",
      "- No hemoptysis: 1\n",
      "- No recent trauma or surgery: 0 (due to the MVC)\n",
      "- No history of DVT or PE: 1\n",
      "- No exogenous estrogen use: 1\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the context, the explanation and the calculated score based on direct application of criteria (though not the intended use of PERC in this scenario due to the patient's recent trauma and age) would be:\n",
